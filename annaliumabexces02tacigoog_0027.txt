coins struck there under their permission ¹. The same fact, and the
year of office, are shown respecting L. Asprenas by an inscription ¹.
Another shows Μ’. Lepidus to have been proconsul of Asia ⁸.

5. lt is stated that the tribunitian power, though never given to
Germanicus, was afterwards given to Drusus, about a year before his
death ⁴. This title, absent on all records of Germanicus, appears on
coins of Drusus, but without record of more than a second year of
office ¹.

6. lt is stated, that in the inscription of a statue dedicated by Julia
Augusta to Augustus near the theatre of Marcellus, her name was
placed before that of Tiberius¹. The Praenestine Calendar gives (nith
a date) the fact, and the locality of this dedication, and places the names
in this order, thus apparently following the original inscription ¹.

manicas, held the honorary office of praefectus urbi ⁹.

8. The statement, that Smyrna was chosen as the site of the temple

the temple, and having all three names on the superscription ¹¹.

urbi ¹¹, is confirmed by the ‘Acta Arvalium ¹³!

A few instances of less direct confirmation may here be added :-

1. A soldier named Rufus Helvius is mentioned as having received
acivic crown ¹¹. An inscription bears the name of ‘M. Helvius Rufus
Civica, prim(us) pil(us),' suggesting the assumption of a cognomen re·
cording the distinction¹¹.

2. C. Silanus is stated to have had a sister, Torquata, ‘priscae sancti·
moniae virgo ¹¹! inscriptions mention ‘lumin C. Silanr'fi, T orqrruta,' as
a Vestal virgin, and as chief of that body ¹¹.
