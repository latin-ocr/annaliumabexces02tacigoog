all besims thern. Contemporary history has to be gradually built up
by incorporating fragrnentary narratives into systematic treatises, and
only by degrees attains completeness. Nonianus, a pleader aod senator
of long standing, would have had much personal knowledge of a limited
kiud': Bassus, who may not have been a senator at all ³, might easily
have had greater experience elsewhere, aud in his tum may have had
thorteomings⁴ which Pliny and others could supplement.

Nor are we without positive evidence that Tacitus had noticed omis·
sions in bis chief authorities for this period. They had cut short the
dreary recital of state trials and left him to search elsewhere to complete
the record ⁶. No previous writer, Greek or Roman, seems to have done
full justice to Anniuius⁸. No one earlier than Pliny had preserved the in·
cident turned to such account by Seianus against Agrippinal; her important
political move iu secking a second husband would have been unknown
but for her daughter's memoirs⁸3 the presage respecting Galba's future⁹
would have been recorded by no one who wrote before its fulfilment

Of the three leading authors named for the Neronian period ¹⁰,
Cluvius alone is never quoted with disapproval. Still, if he were the
mam source, the references to the others could hardly be second-hand ¹¹,
and they may have known much that he did not. He would represent
the best clement in the ‘comitatus' of Nero¹² ; Pliny, besides being the
man of widest reading, would have had most knowledge outside Italy ¹³;
Rusticus, with whatever reserve his statements were to be received,
would have known most of Seneca's life and policy ¹⁴.
