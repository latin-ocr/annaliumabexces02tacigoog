32. Partitive or quasi-partitive. The abundance os such genitives
is characteristic ol Tacitus, as also the frequency with which the partitive
idea is almost or altogether lost sight of, and the genit. equivalent to
a simple adj. as in poetry. Cp. strata viarum (Lucr. and Verg.).

pron. in the nom. or accus. (Roby 2296)2 thus umido, lubrico paludum
1. 62, 2; 65, 6. The use oi such agen. aiter an adj. or pron. govemed
by a preposition is especially rare (llladv. 285, Obs. 2), asin prominenti

(b) After neuter plural, still more frequent: as cuncta curarum 3. 35,
1 ; cuncta scelerum 24. 60, 1 ; tacita suspicionum 4. 41, 2 ; simulationum

list given by Nipp. on 3. 39.

(d) With aduerbs. Tacitus adopts treety Livy's extension os the
Ciceronian usage with ubi, ubicunque, longe, to eo, and huc: as eo
luroris 2. 28, 2, &c.; huc adrogantiae 3. 73, 2, &c Dr. (6 67) notes
