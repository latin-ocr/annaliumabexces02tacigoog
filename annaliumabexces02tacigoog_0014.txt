PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. lx

assisted me Ι must make special mention os Mr. F.
Haverfield, who has called my attention to many points
requiring reconsideration,‘and has directed me to many
inscriptions and special treatises os which Ι should other·
wise have been ignorant.

Thanks to such aid, it will, I hope, be found that this
edition, whatever its present demerits, shows a consider-
able advance on the former, both as regards the cor·
rection of errorS, and the recognition of later means os
information. ln the Introduction, especially, large por·
tions have been altogether re-written, and the whole
carefully revised and sew pages os the notes are without
more or less important additions and alterations; while
the amount of minor errors to be removed has proved
t0 be sar beypnd what my critics had noted or Ι had
mysels expected to find.

Under these circumstances the size of the volume has
been perhaps unfortunately increased; and some apology
seems due for an addition os about fifty pages to an
amount os commentary which many may have already
thought excessive. lt was, however, hardly possible to
bring the book up to date without some increase in bulk;
and Ι may say that the new matter would have consider·
ably exceeded the amount mentioned if it had not been
compensated by omissions and curtailments wherever it
seemed possible to make such without loss of usesulness.

To any who have carried their studies deeply into the
vast array of literature on Tacitus enumerated in the
‘Bibliotheca Scriptorum Classicorum' os Engelmann and
Preuss (8th ed, Leipzig, 1882) ¹, such a list os works

¹Nenrly iorty pages, most os them and the list os separate treatises on special
closely printed in small type, are taken subjects or questions. Several pages more
up with enumerations ol editions or trans· would be required to complete the cata·
latiens ol the whole or parts ol Tacitus, logne to the present date.
