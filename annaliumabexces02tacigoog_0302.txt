bears out this account by speaking 01

governing Macedonia and Achaia still
later (5. 10, 5), and 11 holding ‘maximae

the government 01 1 peaceinl province
was mere ‘ iurisdictio' (ad Q. P. 1. 1, 7).
Hence Ern. and others refer this term
here to the senatorial provinces. But
only the direct appolntments 01 Tiberius

Caesarian there were peacesul provinces,
10 which the term may well be applied.
