Romaine' os Visconti and Monge23 on questions of
Roman topography, mostly to Professor Middleton
(⁶ The Remains of Ancient Rome,’ London, 1892), some
times also to Mr. Dyer and ΜΓ. Burn. In references to
Dr. Smith's Dictionaries, the authors of the articles are
mostly cited by name; on questions of general Latin
Lexicography it is to be understood that the Latin
Dictionary of Messrs Lewis and Short is usually,
referred to.

It hardly needs to be said that, out of the large
number os references given, whether to ancient authors,
to inscriptions, or to modern works‚ a vast majority had
been already given in previous editions or lexicons, and
are due to no research on my part. 1 may, however, say
that, with some allowance for possible oversights,l be-
lieve that 1 have verified all which are not expressly
cited at secondhand, and that Ι have also verified and
consulted a very large number more, which, sor various
reasonS, it did not seem necessary to insert.
