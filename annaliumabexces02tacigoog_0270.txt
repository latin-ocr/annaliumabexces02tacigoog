minius turbator Germaniae, Segestes parari rebellionem saepe
alias et supremo convivio, post quod in arma itum, aperuit
suasitque Varo ut se et Arminium et ceteros proceres vinciret:
nihil ausuram plebem principibus amotis, atque ipsi tempus

afore, quo crimina et innoxios discerneret. sed Varus fato ets
vi Armini cecidit: Segestes quamquam consensu gentis in
bellum tractus discors manebat, auctis privatim odiis, quod
Arminius filiam eius alii pactam rapuerat, gener invisus inimici

irarum apud infensos erant.

6. anneni: so spelt in 1. 88, 33 11. 16, 1, 7. 8. iuimicus socer Pichena

Dianam aut Apollinem venerandi’ (3.
63, 6); and Nipp. on 1. 3ο.

1. parari rebellionem.. . apamia.
His conduct is stated below as repre·

seems not bere thought of ; so that it is
better to talre the words as genit. sing,
and explain thern by supposing that
‘invisus' aud ‘inimici’ are to be dis·

sented by himself (c. 58), and is men·
tioned hy Velleius (1. 118, 4); bnt he
does not appear in the narrative of Dio
(381888). Germana used to discuss
important matters orer their feasts [G.
22,3; H. 4. 14, 3); but ou this occasion
the chiefs appear to have been guests of
Varus (c 58, 4).

4. principibus, here apparently equi·
valent to ‘proceras’ but usually denoting
German magistrates rather than nobles:
see Introd. to Germania, p. 11.

5. erimina et innoxios This iuter·
change of persons and things, similar to
‘insontibus .. .‚ manifestis flagitiis’ (11.
16, 1), aad one of many variations noted
by Drager (ς 1331, is made more natural
by the frequent use in Tacitus of abstract
for concrete (Introd. v. ξ 1).

fato. On tlre conception of fate in
Tacitus see lntrod. lv. p. 29. The blind·
ness of Varus is similarly explained by
Velleius (a. 118, 4).

8. filiam. Seec. 57, 5.

inimici soceri. These words are
taken by Halm as in the nominative

tinguished; the meaning being that Ar·
minius, already at enmity with Segestes
on public grounds, was additionally
hateful tobim from the way in which
he became hia aon-lulaw. This would
be expanded in the next sentence (⁴ quae·
que. . . erant ')‚ where ‘apud infensos'
answers to ‘inimicl,’ and ‘incitamenta
irarum’ to ‘invisus' N ipp. had formerly
read ‘inimicus socerl'from the analogy
of ⁶ inuisus avunculo infensusque’ (ll. 4.
ζα, 3), aad from the likelihood of a loss
ere of the terminal ‘a’

11. Igitur: this takes up the narradve
from ‘praecepit' (c. 55, 1).

ra. tumultuarias: so in ¹5· 3,3; Η.
4. 1ο, a: 66,1; aad often in Livy, for
troops levierl on an emergency. Such
are also called ‘subitus miles¹ (H. 4.
76, 1), and ‘solitarii' (Liv. 3. 4, 11).

13. caesinas. The service for which
118 was detached is shown below, where
the mention of the Marsi suggests that
his advance was in the same direction aa
that of last year (c. 50, 5¹)-

totidem legiones. The four legions

plural, on the suppositiou that the father of the Upper army (cp. c. 37, 4) are
of Anninius is the Segimerus mentioned under the special command of Germa·
by Dio (56. ¹9· 1) as sharing in the re· nicus in this campaign: hence their
bellion, and that he and Segestes were legatus, Silius, is unmentioned. See
therefore enemies. But Segimerus, who c. 72, 1.

was probably now dead (see 2. ro, 1), 14. patsml amstdll. Taunus(cp. 11.
