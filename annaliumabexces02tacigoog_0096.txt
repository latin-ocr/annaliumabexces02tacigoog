that it never appears in the regular list of those borne by the Caesar,
and when used at all in inscriptions, has almost always some personal
term of honour accompanying it, as ‘princeps optimus,’ ‘princeps et
conservator ¹,’ &o

His new position is, as it were, consecrated by the title of Augustus,
decreed by the senate ¹, and assumed on the 16th of January 727,
a. c. 27 ³; a title expressive of sanctity, and a step to the divine honours
paid to him, even during life, in various parts os the empire⁴. This
title is always distinctive of the ‘princeps’ and, until the division of the
empire in later times, is shared with no one.

ln the middle of 7 31, ac. a 3, Augustus closed his series of consulships,
afterwards holding this office twice only, each time for a few days, on the
introduction of his grandsons to public life ⁸. Some of the most essential
privileges of that office are still reserved to him ⁶, but increased stress is
now laid on the tribunician power, which from this time is assumed as
a title and reckoned annually stom June 27⁷. There is no trace of
annual re-election, and the object ol the change seems to hemerely to
substitute some other computation of his years of rule for that supplied
by bis consulships. lt has been thought that a nominal change was
made from ‘ius tribunicium' to ‘tribunicia potestas ⁸,' and that the power
was further defined and amplified. ,

Α further step is marked by the offer made to him in 735, nc. 19, of such
censorial power as belonged to the ‘regimen legum et morum'! Itis
also stated by Dio that he received at the same time for life the consular
power, with its insignia, the regular attentlance of twelve lictors, and
acutule chair between those ol the consuls of the yearll. This is riow
generally treated as an error, except so far as relates to the mere
'assumption os the insignia¹¹. Augustus himself mentions two facts
only that bear upon the point. Firstly, thatin 732, tac. aa, he refused
the dictatorship, and also both the annual and perpetual consulship ¹².
Secondly, that twice in the latter part of his life he held a census with
