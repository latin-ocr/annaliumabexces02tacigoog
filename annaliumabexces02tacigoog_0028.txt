cm. 11.] GENUINENESS OF THE ANNALS. 11

a ‘delecta manus ¹‚’ subsequently called an ‘ala ¹.' His name appears
to suggest the origin os an ‘ala lndiana' mentioned iu several in-
scriptions ⁸. ,

4. Caninius Gallus is mentioned as one os the quindecimviri, and as .
‘scientiae caerimoniarumque vetus ⁴,'a description suitable to a person
nho can be shown to have existed at that unse, and to have been
‘magister fratrum Arvalium ⁸.’

Other instances might, no doubt, be added, but the above will pro-
bably be considered sufficient.

Another curious apparent confirmation will tend, is admitted, to
carry back the date os these Books nearly to that os their reputed
autbor. ln the account os the Frisian rebellion occurs the sentence
‘ad sua tutanda digressis rebellibus ⁶.' Ptolemy‚ writing in the gene·
ration next to that of Tacitus, in his list ol towns in north Germany
inserts Σωτουτὰνδα as the name ol a place⁷3 which certainly looks
as it he had the passage ol the Annals before him, and misunder-
stood it.

ln the later Books ol the Annals, the principal inscription to be con·
sidered is that containing parts of the speech os Claudius, which indeed
[rom its dissimilarity in many respecta to that given in the Annals has
been cited as evidence on the other side. lt must here suffice to refer
to the reasons shown elsewhere⁸ lor thinking that the composition in
the Annals was based on a knowledge os the original speech, though
much ireedom was used in dealing with it.

whatever may be thought oi this, there are other and more indisputable
confirmations of statements iound only in these Books, similar to those
above noted in Books l-Vl. We may ask from what source Bracciolini
could have ascertained, or by what lelicity he could have imagined that
Cadius Rufus was governor os Bithynia ', Eprius Marcellus os Lycia ¹⁰,
Tarquitius Priscus of Bithynia ¹¹, L. Antistius Vetus ol Asia ¹¹, that Clodius
Quirinalis was ‘ praelectus classis ¹³‚’ and Gavius Silvanus tribune ol a prae·
torian cohort ¹⁴, that Silanus had a daughter lepidast, that the names ol
