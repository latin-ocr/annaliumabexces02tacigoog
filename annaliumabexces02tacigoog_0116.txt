ol precedente in the ‘lex' ol his successor ¹, or by the milder ἀτιμία ol
refusing deification ¹. Among other sormidable ‘secret principles ol the
constitution' revealed in 821, an. 68, was also this, that the senate could
eren unmake and outlaw a living princeps, through the old formula,
inwoked by Tiberius against his own natural beust of declaring him
a public enemy ⁴.

Without doubt the early principes owed much ol the stability ol
their rule to their subtle manipulation ol republican ideas. Not even
‘the extinction ol' the bolder spirits hy proscription and battle ⁵, and the
growth ol ‘s generation bent on slavery⁸‚' helped them more than
the homage paid at least in the letter to constitutional forms, the respect
lor which, even in the character ol fictions and survivalS, is so marked
a trait os the Roman mind; especially at a time when demorallsation
and its remedies were alilre felt to be burdensome⁷, and men could
neither bear complete bondage nor complete liberty ⁸. ls Julius Caesar
might have pleaded that he had but gone a step further on the path os
Sulla; Augustus, with sar more prudence, made a show os imitating
the great autocrat os the aristocracy only in his wish to abdicate3 while
ruling under more slrillul disguise, and with more complete precedente.
Men might recollect, and were, no doubt, industriously reminded, that
even his more irregular powers were severally such as their fathers had
acquiesced in: that there had always been a constitutional right to com·
mend and to reject candidates lora magistracy': that the senate had
been always in theory no more than an advising body: that a ‘cohors

praetoria' was as old as the days os Scipio Africanus ¹⁰: that Gracchus ·

had contemplated, and partly realised‚ a continuity ol ‘tribunician
powerr’ that Marius and Sulla, and still more Pompeius, and yet more
reoently Cassius ¹¹, had held an ‘imperium maius? embracing more than
one province: that Pompeius again, most dangerous innovator of all, had
been admiral os the state, with power to send his flecta where he would ¹¹ ;
and had even been consul at home, while holding ‘proconsulare irn-
perium' abroad‚ administered by legati in his name ¹³. It was by
