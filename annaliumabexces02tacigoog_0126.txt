emma] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 109

perilous distinctions oi Rome lor the simple duties oi an aedile at
Ulubrae¹. As a fact, the tide still set from Italy, as from the rest oi the
world, to Romer nor do sober critica in any age take the ideal pictores
oi retired liic as altogether serious. However the contrasts drawn by
Roman writers are so iar substantiated, that Vespasiaa not only learnt,
in a municipal horne, the habits which trained him to be the reiormer ol
imperial extravagance; but was also enabled‚ by a stream os new men

oi similar origin, to recruit the eilete Roman aristocracy with an inlusion
oi healthier blood '.

The great work ol Augustus in the enlargement and settlement oi the
empire can be here but very slightly glanced at. There appears to be
substantial truth in his boast that he had advanced the limits oi every
province which had independent nations on its irontier'; and is we
vvere to compare the dominion as he lest it with that existing at the date
oi Actium, we should see to how great an extent the coherent ‘Imperium
Romanurn' ol our maps was his creation. The conquest oi Gaul had
indeed already pushed the frontier to the ocean, but this was flanked on
either side by an imperiectly subdued Spain and a wholly sree Gennany;
avast independent tract surrounded and isolated Italy itsell, Macedonia,
and the subdued portion oi Illyricum3 in the east the provinces ol Asia,
Bithynia, Cilicia, have a similar isolated and patchworlr character. Nor
in the earlier part ol bis sole rule, and the years preceding it, were the
dangers ol even foreign aggressiou in various parts by any means
visionary. Germans irom beyond the Rhine ravaged Gaul⁴3 a Dacian
horde swept over illyricum as sar as Apollonia, and the Bastarnae over
large parts oi Thrace⁶; Parthia had taken advantage oi the dissensions
oi the triumvirs to hold Syria, Palestine, and Asia Minor for two years

at its mercy ⁸ ; in Egypt, Roman territory was invaded by the troops ol
the Nubian queen Candace'3 in Africa the Garamantes and others bad
to be kept at further distance ⁸.

Oi all the problems presenting themselves, the most important was
that oi the centrai European frontier, and it cannot be matter oi surprise
