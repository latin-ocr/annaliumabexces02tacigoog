cmvlll] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 153

their own gratuitous act But there are circumstances of horrible
cruelty in the execution of the young children of Seianus ¹, and of the
aged mother of Fufius Geminus ¹, and in the causes assigned for the
destruction of the descendants of Theophanes⁸z and even if these were
all, such cases are hardly palliated by being few ⁴.
lt is difficult to discuss the tales of abominable profligacy, which
occupy four chapters of Suetonius, and not much more than twice as
many linesin Tacitus ¹. The absence of indication of any special source
from which they were derived, or of any variance among the authorities
in respect of them, would suggest that they were found in the writers
whom he chiefly follows ⁸. This would lead us to lay less stress on the
argument that our earlier extant writers, as Philo and josephus, Seneca
and the elder Pliny, show no knowledge of these stories, the more
so as their incidental notices of Tiberius would not have necessitated the
mention of what they might have known ⁷. But to suppose such tales to
be part of the general and probably contemporary tradition is in no way
to exempt them from criticism‚ and they are very strongly criticised.
The age was certainly one of great and increasing profligaey, but
the prince himself is represented by hostile authors as shocking even
the standard of those times by his enormities, by extreme apologists as
almost alone free from the universal taint, and it is more difficult to
find grounds for a middle view than to accept either without reserve.
Tacitus asserts that latterly less and less concealmerrt was practised⁸,
and that victims were sought out from families of position ⁰, Suetonius
has raked together names and details somewhat harder to fabricate
than vague general charges ¹⁰3 but the secluded life which would
gine scope for such outrages no less facilitated unlimited invention of
scandal ; archives of state trials may often have preserved records of
mere unproved or even disproved libers, afterwards accepted as faets¹¹,
