144 IN Τ RODUC TION. [cm. vttl.

By considering the strength 01 the impelling motives, we are led to 333
3 plain truth in the maxim of Domitian at his best time, that ‘the prince
who does not checlt accusers stimulates them¹:' and there can be no
doubt that Tiberius encouraged them [3033 the first, at least in this sense
and even in a more substantial manner²; aad that (notwithstanding
a few precedents under Augustus ³) his principate is so marked by the
development of the profession of deletion, chiefly in connexion with
charges of treason, as to be not unjustly termed the period of its origin⁴.

We must suppose him 10 have intended the natural consequence, to let
men see that the accuser was always on the watch ⁶, that even trivial acts
or mere words, even the pasquinades so natural to Italian scurrility, were
well within the scope of the law and placed themar his mercy; that by
legal fictions their own household might be forced to be witnesses against
them ⁸, that whatever could be wrung [3033 tortured slaves was evidenoe,
that the senate was only too forward to condemn, while the princeps
reserved to himself the eredit 01 extending clemency to the convicted, aud
that their life and 1031333 depended on his forbearance ².

We need not attribute this to any other motive than to his general
policy 01 keeping himself in the baekground and using the instrumentality
of others, and to that constitutional sels-distrust and suspicion, which
made him even at the outset feel insecura unless surrounded by an atmo-

sphere of intimidation. On any interpretation, while giving [33 more credit
than Tacitus gives at this time fora genuine desire to gosem well, we are
compelled t0 qualify our praise by ‘si maiestatis quaestio eximeretur!
