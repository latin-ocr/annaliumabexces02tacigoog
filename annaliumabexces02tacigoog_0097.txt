‘consulare imperium ¹,' censorial power being, in the theory of the oon·
stitution, inherent in the consular, before the existence of the censorship
as a separate office. It is inserted, both from what he says and from

what he appears to impl), that this ‘consulare imperium’ was used for
this purpose only, and that no general or permanent consular power was
ever assumed ².

During the remainder of this principato the chief points to notice are
the successive quinquennial or decennial renewals of the ‘imperium⁸;'
the assumption, on the death of Lepidus in 742, nc. ra, of the office
of ‘pontifex maximus ⁴ ,’ always henceforth held by the princeps until in
the fourth century it came to he refused by Christian emperors and
passed to the bishops of Rome⁶3 and tbe formal acceptance, on universal
acclamation, of the title ‘Pater Patriae’ in 752, ac. 2⁸.

The following inscription gives his titles nearly at the close of his life:
‘Imp Caesar, Divi F, Augustus, Pontii. Maxim, Cos. xiii, Impar,
Tribunic. Potestat. xxxvii, P.P.''

The first succession to the principate must have been modified by the
fact that the successor was already ‘collega imperii,’ and had the tri-
bunicias power ⁸, and afterwards numbered his years of this offioe
without recognizing any change at the death of Augustus. He also
dropped the fiction ol periodical renewal of imperium, though a deceu·
nial festival was held ⁹. He must have at least received by decree the
title of ‘Augustus' which, though he affected some reserve in its use¹⁰,
appears on all his coins and inscriptions ; but he never allowed himself
to be called ‘pater patriae ¹¹.’ lt is also noteworthy that neither Tiberius.
Gaius, nor Claudius, uses the ‘praenomen imperatorisnl The titles
borne by T iberius at the close of his life are seen from an inscription
quoted elsewhere ¹³.

Gaius appears, from the account of Dio, to have been the first to
receive all the powers of the principata by a single decree¹¹; while
