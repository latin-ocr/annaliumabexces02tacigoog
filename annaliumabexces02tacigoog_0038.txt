cmlii-l TACITUS' SOURCES OF INFORMATION. 21

He» with all the materials before him which we have, and much more
which we bave not, finds himself, at the establishment of the principate,
passing horn daylight into comparative darkness, dcepening, no doubt,
towards bis own time, as publicity was more and more suppressed.

In former days, public affairs were discussed before senate and people,

by persons of every chade of opinion ; now the forum was silenced, even
the minutes of the senate were no longer published, and the vast depart-
ments centred in the princeps received their intelligence and transacted
their business in private, and communicated no more than they thought
tit What was divulged could not be tested, and those who disbelieved the
information had only surmise to substitute for it. Sometimes, no doubt,
light was afterwards thrown on a darlr place, through the record of their
own transactions by public men ¹, or authentic private communications
which found tbeir way into history, and exposed the falsifications of an
imperial bureau. Tacitus, for instance, or his informants, seem to have
had means of knowing that the official report of Tiberius on the Gallie
revolt was no more nor less than rmrh²; and that, on the other hand, he
bad concealed the extent of the losses inflicted by the Frisii ⁸. It must be
plain, to take no further instanceS, that our full narrative of the Pan-
nonian and German mutiny, and of the German wars, can be no mere
transcript of the report laid before the senate ⁴.

But as regards all matters not forcing themselves by their magnitude
on public notice, much of the most interesting history must have been
buried for ever in the archives of the prince. To illustrate this, we may
compare the information, scanty as it is, which we have inthe Annals, of
the grievances, deputations, inner life of a senatorial province such as
Asia, with the absence of even any similar accounts of any Caesarian
province during this period. We should have known little enough, from
official, or indeed from any purely Roman sources, of the grievances
brought by Philo before Gaius, or of the oppressions which goaded
Judaea to desperation ⁵.

Many again of the state trials which form so large a part of domestic
history were either before the emperor's private court ⁸, or cases in which
the senate merely registers a sentence, passed on receipt of a letter or
notes of evidence from the prince or even his minister ⁷.

Authentic information thus was scanty, but Tacitus notices afurther
