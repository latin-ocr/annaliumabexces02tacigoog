By the end ol the second ‘quinquennium' at the close ol 7²¹· sc. 33,
Lepidus had been deposed, and war with Antonius was imminent.
Hence, though Antonius appears to have styled himself ‘triumvir' till
his death ¹, Caesar (at least in his retrospect) limits the lormal term oi that
office to the ten years’; and then claims a power quasi-dictatorinl, or
a virtual concentration ol the whole triumvirate in himself, not, apparently,
by formal vote, but by general consent. ‘Iuravit in mea verba tossa ltalia
sponte sua, et me blello] quo vici ad Actium, ducem depoposcit ³.‘ ‘Per
consensum universorum [potitus rerum omn]ium' (iyxsmrhyr γενόμενος
πάντων τῶν πραγμάτων) ⁴.

hiso, alter a short second consulship in 721, ac. 33, he enters on
a continuotts series os nine consulships, his third to his eleventh, 723-731,
sc. 31-23⁸.

The following inscription ol the year 725, sc. 29, shows the titles
which he then bore, but makes no mention os the tribunician power :-
‘lmp Caesari, Divi Juli ι, cos. quinct.‚ cos. design. sext, imp. sept ‘.’

We corne now to the acts ol 726, 727, tac. 28, 27, the tendency ol
which is described lrom very different points οι view. Caesar himself
claims to have then restored the Republic: ‘Rempublicam ex mea
potestate in senat[us populique Romani a]rbitrium transtuli ⁷.’ This
statement is echoed by writers near the time ⁸, and a coin ol this date
describes him as ‘libertatis P. R. vindex ’.’ On tlte other hand, Dio
alludes to this time as the date ola re·established monarchy¹⁰, and
Tacitus as the permd when the ascendency os Caesar was secured ¹¹.
The reconciliation is simple: the extraordinary dictatorial and con-
stituent powers surviving lrorn the triumvirate, aiter spending their
soree in these enactments¹², are surrendered, and all the arbitrary acts
os that period cancelled¹³3 but the permanent constitution ol the prin-
cipale begins. The senate and the comitia resume their regular lunc-
tions; and, aiter an ostensive restoration os all the provinces, armies,
and revenues¹‘, the unarmed provinces are actually given up, and those
