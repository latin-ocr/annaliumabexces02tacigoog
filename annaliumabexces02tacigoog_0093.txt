7⁶ INTRODUCTION. [cmvi.

by the tribune P. Titius, creating ‘triumviri reipublicae constituendae,’
with consular power, for five years¹; at the end of which they assumed
another five years of power by their own act, without any formal vote ².

At some early date during this period Caesar had assumed a title
of permanent importance, the ‘praenomen imperatoris ³.’ Suetonius
ascribes this praenomen to the dictator⁴; who, however, appears from
inscriptions to have borne the title immediately after his family name,
before his titles of office ¹. It is suggested that the title, in this position,
became a kind of additional cognomen, such as his heir might adopt;
and that, in usage, he might he styled indifferently ‘Caesar Imperator'
or ‘Imperator Caesar,’ as men might speak of ‘Aemilius Paullus¹ or
‘Paullus Aemilius ‘.' However this may he, this praenomen is hence-
forth always assumed hy Octavianus. his proper praenomen and gentile
name drop out of sight, ancl he becomes ‘Imp Caesar. iii vir R.t>.c.².'

From this must be distinguished the ‘nomen imperatoris‚’ which also
he now began to assume as a permanent title ⁸. This was given, as in
old times, by acclamation on the field of battle ⁹, and was received hy
Augustus twenty-one times in his hfe¹⁰‚ for victories gained in person
or through lieutenants 11; of which he had already numbered seven in
725, ac. ²9 ¹².

Also it appears that, in some form, he had received in 718, uc. 3⁶,
a tribunician power ¹³. thther we talre the authority followed hy
Appian and repeated by Orosius, stating that he was in that year
chosen tribune for life ¹⁴; or that followed by Dio, according to which
the sacrosanctity and seat of a tribune were decreed to him in this
year, and the power itself in 724, ac. 30 ¹³ ; he will in either cascharae
held it before 731, ac. 23, from which date the years of its tenure as
a title are numbered ¹“.
