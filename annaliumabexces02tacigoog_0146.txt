cmvii] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 129

Consocrnarrorr or rur Eunus.

Augustus is said to have bequeathed at his death not a mere aggregate
ol territories‚ but an organiaed whole ¹, and one which seemed to himself
to bave reached its proper limit¹. The administration‚ especially ol the
provinces and armies, was centralized in a way previously unknown,
and the improvement ol roads⁸ and institution of couriers‘ gave new
rapidity to inter-communication: and, not to speak ol his periodical

linancial statements⁸, his summary os the whole position oi the empire,
published aster his deatb⁸, must have given to the senate a new insight
into its organization. ll, beyond this, neither he nor his successor had
devised any plans ior bringing the whole mass into a condition ol homo·
geneous unity‚ it is none the less evident that tendericies in this direction
were constautly operating. The practical recognition os common inter·
ests between rulers and ruled; the security of traffic; the vast require·
ments ol the city os Rome, both as regards necessaries ol lile⁷ and
luxuries⁸; the local centres of traffic aliorded especially by camps and
colonies’; must have tended‚ even more than the centralized government‚
to level the barriers ol nations Two languages again were more and
more taking the place ol a Babel ol tongues: the prevalence ol Greek
in the East may be estimated lrom the extent of its use among even
a race so tenacious ol nationality as the Hebrews ¹⁰3 while, in the west,
Latin, already prevalent in Gaul, making the vemacular iorgotteu in
many parts ol Spain ¹¹, and generally spoken also in Pannonia ¹², was
not wholly lost even by Rome's bitterest enemies¹³; aud, as the general
official language of the cuspite, bad some hold even in the East¹⁴.
Again, though Tiberius probably imitated the reserve ol Augustus in
bestowing the ‘civitas ¹¹ ;’ yet even this great equalization os privilege must
