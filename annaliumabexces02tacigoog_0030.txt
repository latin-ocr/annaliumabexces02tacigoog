CHAPTER Ill.

ΟΝ THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION OPEN ΤΟ TAClTUS FOR
THIS PERIOD3 AND THElR PnonnBLn VALUE.

Non-H. Haupt, writing in 1885 (Philol. 44, pp. 131-163) on the portion of Dio
which goes side by side with Tacitus, reriews some twenty-seven trentises up to that
date, bearing on this subject or connected with it. The study oi his abstract oi them
tends rather to hewilder thau to instruct. Α tull and clear exposition of the whole
subject is given in 1 recent work by hl. Philippe F abia (Les sources de Tacite, Paris,
1895), the larger part of which, however, deals with the Histories.

1. anrrrsn narratives of the general history of the period or of
parts of it

It is not the habit of Tacitus to name his informants; and in the
first six Books he has done so twice only, citing the history of the
German wars by C. Plinius ¹, and the memoirs of the younger Agrip
pina ², in each case for an incident relating to the elder Agrippina, lt ·
is stated in the latter case, and apparently lmplied in the former, that

he is taking from a less usual source something overlooked by those '

whom he generally follows. ln the later Books we have references
to the general history of Pliny ⁸, to Cluvius Rufus ⁴, to Fabius Rusticus ⁵,
and to Domitius Corbulo ⁸.

General references arc far more commum arrd give evidence that
there were many such works, and that his history was mainly drawn
