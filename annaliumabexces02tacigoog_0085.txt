the instances are trivial (see the so·called hexameters in 3. 44, 43 15.
9, 15 73, 4; Agr. ro, 4); one only is noteworthy forits rhythm
(auguriis patrum et prisca formidine sacrum G. 39, a), and one other
for its position, as forming a complete period, and aa the opening
sentence of the Annals. The hexameter with which Livy begins is,
as far as it goes, much more rhythmical, and he has many more such
verses or parts of verses than Tacitus. No more can be proved, than
that the ear of neither of these historians was so sensitive in avoidance
of such cadences, as that of Cicero (see de Orat. 3. 43, 182; Orat. 56,
189) or Quintilian (see 9. 4, 7 ).

80. Ellipses, and mmilar abbreviated expressions. By far the
most important of these are found in syntactical usages already noticed,
in a large proportion of which the desire of brevity of expression appears
prominent3 especially in the omission of pronouns (ξ 8), of verbs (ξ) 38,
39), of prepositions (see references on ξ 56), and other particles (ξ) 64,
65); in tlte fondness for concise constructione with the infinitive (§§ 44,
43, 44, 46), with gerund and gerundive (ξ) aa, 36, 33), with in and tlte
accusative (ξ 60 b), with nisi and ni (ξ 5ο). Α few other ellipses are
noted by Dr. ξ 438, such as omissions of pars (4. 20, 3), annus (rr. 11,
ι), dies (4. 45. 4), lex (3. 25, ι), uxor (4. rr, 4), filia(ra. 1, 3), &c.;
many of which would be common in any approach to colloquial forms,
as in comic poets and in the letters of Cicero, as well as in inscriptions
See Gud. Introd. cxviii, and the special treatise of G. Clemm ‘De brevilo-
quentiae Taciteae quibusdam generibus,' Leipzig, 1881.

81. 'Pha nequent use of partieipial otauses tends to conciseness
(see ξ) 31, 54, 55), and is characteristic of Tacitus ; as is illustrated by the
comparison made by Draeger (ξ 238) between simple narrative passages
of the same length, in Caes. B. G. 2. 1-a ; Sall. Jug. 6-73 Liv. 21. 53
and Ann. 2. 11-1a; in which, respectively, the participial clauses are 5,
10, 16, ancl 24. lnstances of such participial and also of adjectival
clauses are given by Nipp. on 3. 55 ; 4. 64.

82. Parentheses. Besides the explanatory accusative already noticed
(ξ ra a), Tacitus frequently has a parenthetical word or expression in
appositiou in tlte nominative, equivalent to a complete relative clause; as
vix credibile dictu 1. 35, 6 ; mimm dictu 2. 17, 4; incertum is thus
used by Livy, &c.; dubium by Ovid, &c.; rarum by Tacitus alone, and
chiefly in the Annals, 1. 39,7 ; 56,a;6. 10,3; ¹3· s,2;also H. 4.
ra, 3. For more complete parenthetical sentences, see 4. 55, 6; ra.
