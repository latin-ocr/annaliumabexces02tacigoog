ΟΝ THE ‘LEX ΡΑΡΙΑ ΡΟΡΡΑΕΑ.’ 487

specific thing with children, in the second place to heirs with children, in
the third to other legatees with children ¹, falling all these, to the aera-
rium ², or, in later times, to the fiscus.

This law, though having sor its apparent object ‘to add force to the
penalties on celibacy and to enrich the treasury⁸,’ encountered no such
vigorous opposition as that which had blunted the edge ol the ‘lex
Iulia ⁴.’ The senate had been schooled by twenty-five years ol submissim,
and people had perhaps found out that it was easier to evade laws than
to resist their enactment. The consuls from whom this law is named
were both unmarried ⁵ ; nor, according to Tacitus ⁶, did marriage or the
rearing ol children become more frequent.

In one respect the law was indeed most fruitlul. By it was given the
first general encouragement, on a large scale, and in a matter affecting
private life, to systematis delationi, and the first brood of professional
informers was called into being 3 whose activity in respect to other laws,
and especially that of ‘maiestas' fonns so large a part of the domestic
history of the age. When this activity was let loose upon alaw whose
- vast and complicated networlr was such as to entangle every lamily in
some or other ol its meshes⁸, we can easily see that its working must
have caused intolerable annoyances unforeseen at its enactmem, and can
understand the outcry which in ten years was already demanding relaxa·
tion. The law itsclf thus marks the extreme limit of legislative interser-
ence with private lile in this respect, and its subsequent history as known
to us is that of its mitigation. ‘Many of its entanglements were
resolved' by the commission under Tiberius ⁰, another important pro-
vision was relaxed by Claudius ¹⁰, the rewards ol informers were cut down
by Nero ¹¹, and princes olten gave the ‘ius liberorum' to those who had it
not ¹². Thus the severity os many ol its penalties became so lar obsolete
