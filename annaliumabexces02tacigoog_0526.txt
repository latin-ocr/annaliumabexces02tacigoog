being used under similar circumstances
to the other (in 6. 27, ι). It seems better

5. stiam tum. Α contrast is implied
to the later prevalence oi private trials

charge against Caesar's own procurator

a. 47, 3, &c This passage would
evidence of the existence of such imperial
officers, at least in Asia (see also note on
a. 47, 5), before the time of Claudius,
from which date they are fully attested
by inscriptions in all senatorial provinces
(see Marquardt‚ 1. 555, u. 5). On their
limited powers at this time see next note.
ln13. 1, 3, similar officere are described
as ‘rei familiari principis in Asia inpositi!
An inscription of run. ιο5 (C. 1. L. v.
875) shows a procurator of Asia appointed
by the emperor (probably one of the
Flavian Caesars) to talre the place of
a deceased proconsul.

the ordinary courts. A distinct juris·
diction is given to them under Claudius
(see ou ιο. 6ο, 1).aud they become quite
independent of the proconsul: cp. Dig. 1.

quae ad procuratorem principis respicit,

melius fecerit (proconsu ) si abstineat!
