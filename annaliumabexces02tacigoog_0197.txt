180 P. CORNELII YACITI ANNALIUM

Caesarem, Lepidi atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere,
qui cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa nomine principis sub impe·
rium accepit. sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversat
claris scriptoribus memorata sunt; temporibusque Augusti di·
scendis non defuere decora ingenia, donec gliscente adulatione
deterrerentur. Tiberii Gaique et Claudii ac Neronis res floren-⁶
tibus ipsis ob metum falsae, postquam occiderant, recentibus
o‘dffi‘cd'rripositae sunt. inde consilium mibi pauca de Augustos
et extrema tradere, mox Tiberii principatum et cetera, sine ira
ro ct studio, quorum causas procul habeo.
