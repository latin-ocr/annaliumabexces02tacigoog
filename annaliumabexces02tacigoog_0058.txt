the more studiously seek to create variety, and stimulate the flagging
interest oi the reader, even by' ever so short an episode¹; by a de·
parture lrom his usual order 01 narrative⁹; by multiplying, artihcially
aud even sanciiully, the expressions lor constant occurrences³; by
a hundred small variatious in the structure 03 arrangement 01 sentences⁴;
by straining ruore and more aster novelties, or by occasionally reviving
archaisms in vocabulary or 33133333υ ; by anything to break the weary
sameness os his chronicle 01 tyranny.

The old criticism, tracing the characteristics ol the style 01 Tacitus
to poetic colouring, and to the study 01 brevity and ol variety ⁶, will be
seen to be well founded, and to be capable ol explanation from the
circumstances os his lile and nature ol his subject; and to show the
natural gists, not unmixed with the natural delectans the most finished
pleader oi 333 age which required above all that its orators should be
33333, brilliant, 3ηά striking.

Historical style was all the more likely to be rhetorical, owing to the
custom 01 0331 recitation. From many instances in which the effect
on the ear seems to be studied, and others in which 0331 emphasis
would have removed au ambiguity‚ it is not improbable that Tacitus
may have adopted this general practice.

To these should be added the most truly personal 01 311 his traits
of style, the elevation and dignity (σεμνότης) known to have characterized
the orator ⁷, and which, iu the relation not only oi great matters, but
also ol what is trivial‚ or even revolting, appears never to be lost sight ol
by the historian.

The following instances 333 almost wholly restricted to the liuhais,
not only on account 01 the limits of the present work, but also because
these are the most truly Tacitean oi all the writings 01 Tacitus; many
uses and expressions, rare or even unknown in his earlier writings‚ being
in them frequent and even habitual ⁸.

The arrangement 01 Draeger‚ whose sections are cited throughout, is
