x PREFAOE ΤΟ THE SECOND EDITION.

made use of as is given above, or to be gathered from the
whole os this volume, will seem meagre in the extreme ;
and even is only well—known writers be taken account of,
1 sear that the most competent critics will be mainly
impressed by the omissions. But whatever hopes I had
formed that the book would give more assistance than
has been hitherto easily accessible to the general student
os this portion of Tacitus have been sar more than
realized by the reception given to it, and by the demand
sor a new edition at an earlier date than I had expected.
The desects still evident in it will not, I hope, be set
down to negligence, but will be excused as those os an
editor who has long since lost the experiente which those
engaged in teaching acquire of what is most likely to
interest or perplex intelligent students.

Classical authors are mostly cited from the texts of
the Teubner series; and it is hoped that the abbrevia-
tions used in referring to them, or to editors or other
modern writers, will generally explain themselves. As
regards Latin inscriptions, the ¹ Monumentum Ancy-
ranum¹ (Mon. Anc.) is cited frum Mommsen's edition
above referred to; the ⁸ Oratio Claudii* from the Appen-
dix to Book XI, in vol. iil: most others from the ‘Cor-
pus lnscriptionum Latinarum' (C. Ι. L.) or the collections
of Orelli and Henzen or os Wilrnanns: Greek inscrip-
tions are cited from Boeckh's ‘ Corpus ' (C. Ι, G.) or the
‘Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum' (C. l. Att.); a few
more in both languages from the ‘Ephemeris Epigraphica'
(Eph. Epig.): any others given are usually cited at
secondhand. In numismatics references are made to
Eckhel (“ doctrina numorum veterum’) and to Cohen
(Medailles Imperiales,' 2nd ed.‚ 1879); on other works
uf art. mostly to J. J. Bernoulli (¹ Romische Iconographie,'
Stuttgart, 1882-1894)‚ sometimes to the ¹ Iconographie
