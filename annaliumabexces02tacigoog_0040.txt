Tur question ol the use made by Tacitus ol the sources open to him
has been ol late chiefly discussed as regards the Histories, and in relation
to the close resemblance oi portioris os that work to Plutarch’s Lives oi
Galba and Otho ², which, on the supposition that neither author has
used the other ³, would show that both had closely followed some
common source, that not only the substance, but sometimes the form,
anderen an epigrammatic turn ol expression had been adopted as it
stands by both ⁴, and that in some cases even a citation of discrepancies
between authors is given at second-hand⁵. Portions os Livy can be
shown to stand in a siinilar relation to Polybius, and it is contended that
such close following of a single author is very general among ancient
historians, and that the reputation oi great writers rests more on literary
skill than industrious research.

The question respecting the Histories, which cannot here be dis·
cussed, turns, it should be remembered, only on a small portion, and
probably in the author's opinion a less important portion oi that work‘3
