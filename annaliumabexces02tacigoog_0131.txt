Augustus had re-established the rule enlorced by Pompeius, prescribing
an interval oi five years between the tenure ol magistracy and the ‘sor-
titio provinciae 1.’ It is however plain lrom the above lists that the
interval ¹iu the case oi consular provinces was now usually much longer.
This would be the natural consequence ol the increased number ol cun·
sulars resulting irom the frequent appointment, especially alter 744, rac.

stagnation in the succession to proconsulships. This again was remedied
in various ways. Some consulars were disqualified 1, others set aside by
the senate ¹⁰ or by Caesar ¹¹, others declined the ‘sortitio ¹⁸! The lists
also show that the order oi seniority was not always adhered to ; being
probably modified by the preference enjoined by the ‘Lex Papia
Poppaea ¹⁸,' and probably also by a postponement oi the turn oi any
who, when their time carne, were absent irum Rome.

provinces, the great prizcs leit to the senatorial award.

having its apex near Philomelium, and comprising, with nearly all
Phrygia, Mysia, Lydia, and Caria, the Aeolian, Ionian, and DoriunGreelr
cities, with most ol the adjacent islands, inclusive ol the Cyclades ¹⁴. The
chiel city and residence ol the governor was Ephesus3 but several others

that ol ‘civitates liberae 11 '3 and it is stated to have contained in all live
hundred urban communities, of whose constant rivalries we have a glimpse
