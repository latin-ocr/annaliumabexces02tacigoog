(6) In place ff tlte prrircr‘pal verb, e. g. six times in 1. 16, ten times in
ligr. 38. Even this is surpassed by Sallust, Jug. 66, 1, where it occurs
eleven times , and by Apuleius, Met. 8. 7, where it occurs twelve times in
one period. Tacitus has it also in the passive, as vitari, deseri 4. 69, 6,
76, 4. Dr.§28d

47. 'rho epexegesis infinitiva (or inf. as genic, or ablat, or ad-
verbial accus) is used, as by puers, where gerund, or gerundive, or other

as a past tense as to be once coupled with the perfect, H. 3. 16, 4 mis·

49. Tacitus carries much further the usage, very· rare before Livy, of
interpositis, ln 1116 midst of ‘oratio obliqua: a parenthetloal or
explanatory relative clausa tutha indicativa. Parenthetical clauses
