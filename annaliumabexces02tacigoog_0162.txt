currunt] TIBERIUS ΛΝΒ Η15 GOVERNMENT. 145

444. 43-48, the ninth to the fifteenth of the rule of Tiberius, and the
sixty-tourtn to the seventieth of his life. The words seem aplatitude,
and the ‘bona' il not admitted to have been real before, must be sup-
posed less real now. Tacitus must be understood to mean that some evil
4441444, such as cruelty and covetousness ¹, begin to escape their disguise,
but that the appearance of many virtues is kept up.

It is at this stage that the figure of Seianus is brought more distinctly
to the frout as the leading intluence ol the period ², though still held in
obeck by Augusta. His portrait, il we had it complete, would no doubt
have been found to be drawn with only less elaboration than that given
to Tiberius himself, and the steps of his rise are still left clearly indicated
to us. He is the personal adherent ol Tiberius alone, dissociated alike
from the rest of the imperial family and from the senate. We have him
described, succeeding to the ‘praefectura praetorii’ as an unimportant
office, and making it the most important position in the state ⁸, already,
though only a knight, admitted to some share in the ‘imperium’ ol the
prince‘, enabled by skilful pretexts to bring about a change more fraught
with results in later Roman history than any other event of this principate‚
by concentrating the guard in a barrack close outside the walls, and
bringing them far closer than before to his personat influence ⁶, promptly
retrieving theone false move of too bold a request for the hand of Livia ⁸,
and soon more than restoring his position bya tucky act of sels-devotionl:
step by step his great aims are steadily advanced‚ Drusus is got rid of, the
family of Germanicus undermined by a series of attacks ⁸, and by the
overthrow of one friend after anothert: through him alone can the great
prizes of state be reached ¹⁰, nobles stooped to compliance to win so much
asan interview, and paid court even to his menials ¹¹, to be accused by
one of his creatures was to make condemnation inevitable ¹².

This whole period is described in an eloquent passage as a dreary
chronicle of ‘cruel orders, incessant accusations, treacherous friendships¹³.'
Under an exaggeration, similar to that of earlier passages ¹⁴, we discem
this truth, that the record of trials, mostly lor state offences, is almost the
sole domestic history of the time; and that, besides a large increase in
the number ol such cases, from about twelve in eight years to about
