the consuls ¹, the senate being conceived as his assessors, as the ‘iudices’
vere those of the praetor¹3 and cases could be brought before either of
these courts or the personal court of the princeps ¹. In practice, the

senate becomes under Tiberius by far the most important criminal
tnbunal of the state, dealing generally with the greatest ⁴, especially
with political, offences, and with criminals mostly of senatorial or eques·
trian rank or family¹. The court is competent to refuse to receive
a case‘, aad has some discretiori in respect of sentence on the accused¹
or amount of recompence to the informer ¹, but is described as powerless
to reconsider a sentence once passed ¹.

Abroad, though no longer controlling the greater provinces, it formally
retains its old power over those remaining to it. To these it appoints
governors, as of old, by lot or otherwise ¹¹ ; from these it receives all
deputations for redress of grievances; one such scene, that of the
audience of the many embassies on the right of asylum, being described
as unusually impressive ¹¹. Petitions, at other times, are addressed to it
for relief of burdens ¹², aad for erection or restoration of temples 1*ς and
judicia] questions of boundary ¹⁴, or property ¹¹. We have even survivals
of tbe old correspondence with foreign princes ¹¹, and embassies of honour
to such as have deserved well of Rome ¹¹.

the more important occurrenees in the provinces ¹¹ 3 and it surprises usto
