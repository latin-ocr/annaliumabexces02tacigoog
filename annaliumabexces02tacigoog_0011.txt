vl PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

all references to other parts of Tacitus; which will, as
it is hoped, greatly lessen the labour of consulting
them ¹.

ln preparing the commentary all the principal editions
have been sreely used. Among earlier ones, especial
obligation must be acknowledged to Walther’s full
summary of the chief textual criticism down to his
own date (Halle, 1831), and the valuable edition 01
Ruperti (llanover‚ 1834), in which all the Excursus of
Lipsius, and the chief results of the labour of other
commentators down to that time are brought together.
Among later editions those most consulted have been
Ritter (Cambridge, 1848), Orelli (2nd ed, by Baiter,
Zurich, 1859), E. Jacob (2nd ed, Paris, 1885), Draeger
(5th ed, Leipzig, 1887), Pfitzner (2nd ed, Gotha‚ 1892),
and Nipperdey (9th 011, by G. Andresen, Berlin, 1892),
also the editions 01 two American scholars, that 01 Ρ10-
sessor Holbrooke (London, 1882) and that of Professor
Allen (Boston 1890).

Ι am repeatedly and constantly indebted; and it is the
more necessary for me here to acknowledge my general
obligation in the most emphatic manner, inasmuch as
the special sources of each note are osten 100 complex
to be easily stated.

Among separate works bearing on the criticism and
interpretation 01 the text, those most used have been
the old ‘Lexicon Taciteum’ of Botticher (Berlin. 18 30).
and as much as has appeared of the complete and ex-
haustive new Lexicon of Gerber and Greef (Leipzig,
1877-1895)², also Draeger's valuable treatise ‘Ueber
