cnm. tv] TACITUS' ΗΒΕ OF HIS MATERIALS. 35

Any such misleading effect of a ‘consensus auctorum' would bo
aggravated, if, as has been seen to be probable in respect to the prin·
’ cipate of Tiberius, the original authorities belonged almost wholly to
the hostile secti0n¹. The critic might feel that he had made a con·
siderable deduction for their prejudices, and might naturally consider
that this was sufficient.

It is also noteworthy that he treats the testimony of his authorities
as evidence not only for an act but for a motive¹; and only with diffi-
dence suggests an explanation of his own ⁸. Here it is probable that
the discrepancy of his witnesses left him much room for choice, and
enabled him, without going beyond the alternatives suggested by them,
to interpret the acts in accordante with his general conception of the
character.

Further explanation must be found in the personal opinions of
Tacitus, andin the circumstances of his life.

His political attitude to the early Caesars could not really be one of
indifference3 for the revolution which they accomplished and con·
solidated was with him the main cause of the degeneracy of his own
age. Loyal as he is to the emperors under whom he wrote ; who had
‘combined monarchy with lreedom⁴' and brought about ‘an age of
rare felicity, in which men might think what they would and say what
they thought⁸;' he could see that the remedy worked far more slowly
than the disease ⁸, and feel the more resentment against the supposed
authors of the latter.

His political sympathies are those of the idealist rather than the

statesman3 his golden age is before the dawn' of history ⁷, and his ·

golden age of Rome, the old Republic seen through the mist of ages,
the time when ‘equitable legislation was crowned by the Laws of the
Twelve Tables';' or, at latest, the days before the fall of the great
foreign powers had developed the dangers of security and peace ⁹.
Himself probably no more connected with the old families than was
Cicero, he yet cannot divest himself of the reverence inspired by their
glories in the history ol the early period ¹⁰. Blind to the misgovern·
ment which alone made revolution possible, he can sce only the in·
trigues of ambitious men who brought about the sall ol ‘liberty'
