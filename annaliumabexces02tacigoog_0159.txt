He is told that ‘the laws are to be enforced,' and an immediate crop of
charges is the result. The whole of the rule of Tiberius is thus an
exceptional period of the activity of this law, immediately afterwards
professedly suspended by Gaius, and really so from the accession of
Claudius, till it was revived, as a potent engine 01 tyranny, in the eighth
year of Nero ¹. lt should be further mentioned that the strict legal
penalty is a severe form of exile, and that all indiction of death undet
this law is an excess'.

During this first period, about twelve trials⁸ may be noted, in which
this is either the sole charge, or more frequently coupled with others⁴.
In two cases acts are alleged. which in any age would have been hesson-
ahle ⁶, if proved ; in the others the charge is grounded either on a more
or less strained interpretation of acts, or, in one or two cases, on wordst
It should be added, that in three cases the charge of ‘maiestas’ is dis·
missed before trial⁷; and that three others result in acquittal⁸; sud
that the one case in which death is inflicted for an offence of words takes
place in the absence of Tiberius, who finds fault with, and takes measures
to prevent in future so precipitate a sentence ⁹.

It may be admitted that the number 01 cases is not large in itself, and
that many among this number seem due to the desire of accusers 1ο
secure a conviction by multiplying counls in the indictment, especially by
adding a charge not less sweeping and formidable than the modern
phrase of ‘conduct calculated to bring the govemment into contempt ;'
a charge especially difficolt to meet under such a constitution as that of
tlte Caesars, resting on innumerable vague lines and fictions. We may
also admit that Tiberius, though with frequent vacillatione of purpose ¹⁰,
shows on the whole at present no disposition to press for convictione, or
for extreme sentences upon conviction. On the other hand, even a 1111111
