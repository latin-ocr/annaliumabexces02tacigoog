cmvut] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 157

it must he borne in mind, has a purpose to serve, in setting off a special
grievance hya contrastof general beneficence of imperial government ¹.
Senem speaks most emphatically of the ‘accusandi frequens et paene
publica tabies' which under this prince caused more loss of civic lives
than any civil war ¹. The chief definite statement of Josephus, that the
long tenure of office by provincial govemors was the result of a deliberate
intention to make them less eager pillagers³, reads like the mere excuse
of Tiberius or his friends for the irresolution and dilatoriness of which we
have such abundant other evidence ; and might have seemed questionable

to Josephus himself if he had thought of the ten years of Pilate.
If we canum check Tacitus by these, we may in turn check by him the

keener appetite for scandal of Suetonius, many of whose tales he must
have known but disdained to notice ⁴, and some of whose generalisations
he has given us the means of reducing to single instances⁶.

Also his more careful discrimination checks the loose credulity of Di0,
whose bewildered judgment seems at last to take refuge ina desperate
attempt to reconcile conflicting testimony by fusi0n; in the statement
that Tiberius ‘had many virtues and many vices, and exercised each as if
they had been his only qualities ⁶.'

The appeal from Tacitus appears thus to lie to Tacitus alone ; to his
candour and sense of nuth, to hisadmissions ol fact ; against his insinua·
tiops and interpretations of motives, against his evident prejudices. That
he was no friend to the founders of the principate has been already
shown²; and, with all allowance for the sincerity of his diselaimer⁸,
special grounds of animosity against Tiberius appear discernible. He
had seen in his own day ‘the extremity of slavery, when even the inter·
change of speech and hearing was destroyed by espionage ⁹.' He tracks
back this systematic delation to its source, and, as it were, charges this
prince with its full-developed iniquity; seeing in these trials for treason
far more than the bare facts which he relates‚ and imagining Carus and
Massa, and the rest of the vile brood of his own time, as already appearing
within view ¹⁰. It would be natural that the memory of the tyrant under
