have had access to them. It is stated that Gaius burnt athis accession
an important part of the J'ournals os Tiberius, containing the record
ol the condemnation ol Agrippina and her sons, and made solemn
profession that he had never read them ¹. However this may be,
other youmals ol this prince are said elsewhere to have been preserved,
and to have formed the favourite study os Domitian ¹.

5. Public Inscriptions. It is needless to speak oi the multitude which
must have been at the time in existence, or of their maniiold value to
historiens. Tiberius is stated to have taken great pains early in bis
principato to preserve and restore ancient documents⁸. We have, how·
ever, no evidence that Tacitus was in the habitos consulting inscriptions,
though he makes mention of decrees so recorded⁴, and once refers to
such evidence os the letters added to the alphabet by Claudius ⁵.

6. Pamphlet literature, chiefly satirical. Probably, in spite os repres-
sion, this existed in considerable amount ⁰, and may have been the
ultimate source ol much that we find in Suetonius.

7. Tradition. The liletlme os Tacitus was not so sar removed from
the days of even Tiberius, but that many traditional anecdotea were
still current. He states a report os this kind, for what it is worth, in
his account of the trial os Cn. Piso⁷3 he mentions, in order to resute
it, an idle tale respecting the death ol Drusus, son of Tiberius⁸; he
seems to refer to oral testimony os living persons on the reality oi the
Pisonian conspiracy ο; and elsewhere contrasts ‘lama’ with ‘auctores ¹⁰,'
and some os his vague expressions, such as ‘traditur,’ ‘ferunt' ‘memoriae
proditur: may in some cases designate such floating stories.

lt will thus be seen that as far as the mere amount os material is
concemed, the resources at the command ol Tacitus were as ample as
are found at most periods ol ancient history. ,

Much, however, of this abundant material must have been untrust·
worthy. The first fundamental defect to notice is that which has been
prominently put forward by Dio, at the transition point in his narrative ¹¹.

¹ Suet. Cal. 15. Dio states that Gaius ‘publica acta’ of 12. 24, 4, are probably
only pretended to burn them (59. 4, 33 inscriptions.
