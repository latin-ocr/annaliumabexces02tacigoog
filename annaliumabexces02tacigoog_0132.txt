in the contentione sor right os sanctuary and respecting the temple to
Tiberius¹.' Onlya passing reference can here be made to the exceptional
knowledge possessed by Tacitus ol this province ¹, to its prominence in
the business before the senate ³, and to the evidence ol its great resources

and high civilisation at all times ⁴, as well as ol its gradual recovery sr0m
the ravages ol war and extortion⁵3 and the general qualities which, in
spite os imperial vigilance, made it in the time ol Nero, hardly less

Africa was bounded on the east by ‘Philaenorum arae ζ’ at the eastern
recess os the Great Syrtis, near Muhktar3 while on the west, during the
independence os Mauretania, the boundary between them was fixed at
Saldae ⁸, identified with Budjsya (Bougie). It had thus acoast line
extending some fifteen degrees ol longitude, and comprising the greater
part oi modern Tripoli, the whole ol Tunis, and a considerable portion
ol Algeria. In the time ol Pliny it contained thirty ‘civitates liberae‚'
fifteen ‘oppida civium Romanomm,’ and six coloniae ⁹; the most lamous
towns in these two latter classes respectively being Utica and
enuagev.

narlare oi Tacfarinas ¹¹ ; but there is abundant other evidence that Africa
was in many respects the most important senatorial govemment, and
therefore with reason the most Jealously watched by Caesar. Next to
Egypt it was the most important source os the corn supply ol Italy ¹²:
and, probably on this account, the proconsul was assisted or controllecl
not by one, but by two or more ‘procuratores fisci ¹³? Again, here alone
