83. zeugma, or the reference to two objects of a verb strictly applic-
able only to the nearest, is also an effort at brevity, even with the risk
of harshness ; and is more common in Tacitus than in any other writer.
See the use of redimi 1. 17,6; probabam 1.58,2; permisit a. 20,2;
appellans 2. 45, 4, intentarent 3. 36, 2; sore 6. 22, 5, nequibat 22. 64,
6 ; and very many others. Akin to this is the frequent use (by Syllepsis)
of a verb with twoobjects in different semes, as 1. 72, 5 3 2. 44, 3, 02 of
anoun exclusively masculine for persons of both sexes, as filii 22. 38, 3 ;
fratres 12. 4, 2; privigni 4. 72, 7; pronepotes 5. 1, 4. Dr. § 239, 3, 4.
Also akin to this is the supplying a plural verb from a singular, asin
3. 29, 53 oran affirmative sense from a negative, as in 12. 64, 6, 23.
56, 3..

84. Prognant construetiona; many such have been mentioned under
other heads (see references on §8o): to which may be added such expres·
sions as ius legationis.. . miseratur 1. 39, 8; proruunt fossas 1. 68, ²3
pericula polliceri 2. 40, 3: ad principem distulerant 3. 52, 3; iniurias
largiri 3. 70, 2; permoveor.. . num 4. 57, 2, &c.; also pregnant mean·
ings of words, as venenum 3. 22, 2; 4. ro, 2; aegriffldo 2. 69, 4;
senecta 11. 26, 2; infantiam 11. 34, 2; gratia 12. 7, 4; Chaldaeos 12.
22,1; ferrum 15. 55, 3, &o Dr.§239, 2.

85. Besides aiming at novelty through the introduction or adoption of
unlamiliar words or senses of words (see §i 69-72),¹1'aoitua comtantty
200122 to avoid monotony by varying forma ottho same word.
Thus Artaxata is twice feminine, five times neuter (see on 2. 56,-3) ;
Tigranocerta four times used in each form (see 24. 24, 6); the form
Vologeses is perhaps sometimes changed to Vologesus (see on 12. 24, dl.¹
So also we have alioqui and alioquin, anteire and antire; balneae and
balneum; dein and deinde; grates and gratias agere; inermis and
inermus; senecta and senectus, 820. ln many other cases such varratiorrs
have been treated by editors as errors of copyists. See Wotfflin, Philol.
xxv. 99-106; 222-227.

86. lfamoa often mentioned ara varied. Thus we have Gallus,
Asinius Gallus and Gallus Asinius, tlte. 3 or the cognomen alone
repeated, when the name has been given more fully above, as Trionis
2. 28, 4; Lepida 12. 64, 5, 6207 also the names of relatives mentioned
