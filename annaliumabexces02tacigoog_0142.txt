03333111] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 125

ol service originally fixed at sixteen ¹, and later at twenty years’ service ².
Probably the same events which led to the enrolment of additional
legions, combined with the exhaustion of the ‘aerarium militare ³,' led
him to postpone his obligations by a characteristic fiction; by which the
vetemus, though removed from the legion and released from the oath,
vere kept together under separate colours, perhaps exempted from camp
duties and reserved for battle ⁴, but awaiting indefinitely their final dis-
cinrge and reward. The words ‘vexillum' ‘vexillarii’ and ‘vexillati0,'
though often used of any legionary detachment under separate commandl,
appear to have 3 special application to these troops, who are distinguished
bom tbe legions by Tacitus in several places'. They might be quar·
tered with ⁷, or separated from their legions 6, and, perhaps by combina-
tion, are sometimes 1000 strong⁹; but if the number 500, the only
mimate of such a battalion given in these Books, may be treated as the
nonnal strength of those belonging to one legion¹⁰, it would agree with
the computation of Hyginus, who reckons them as equivalent to an
extra cohort ¹¹.

3. ‘Cohortes civium Romanorum' are mentioned in several inscriptions,
usually as volunteers‚ frequently as ltalians¹¹3 and may probably have
been generally formed of such as chose a military profession, aud who
lived in other districts thau those from which the home army was raised ¹³.
There appear to have been at one time at least thirty-two such cohorts¹⁴3
but they are omitted in the general summary of Tacitus 66, though men·
tioued with the legions in the will of Augustus ¹⁸.

Other auxr'lrhry forces, ‘Cohorfes alaeque sociae!

These forces are too numerous and manifold to be here described ;
their titles are given in a multitude of inscriptions 66, and their total
strength is estimated by Tacitus as being much the same in the aggregate
