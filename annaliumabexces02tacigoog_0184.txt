and had children by P. Cornelius Scipio ; one of whom, Cornelia, wife
of Aemilius Paullus, has been immortalised by Propertius (El. 4, 11).
He divorced Scribonia the next year, 775, Μ. 39, when her daughter
Julia was just bom; and early in 776, Μ. 38, took place the marriage
vitb Livia, which, though contracted under scandalous circumstances,
resulted at least in a lasting attachment. Scribonia is styled in in·
scriptions ‘Scribonia Caesaris ’ (Orell. 677, Henzen 5367). She lived to
share voluntarily the exile of her daughter in 757, Μ. 7 (Veli. 7. roo, 5).
- 4. Agrippa inscribcs himself on the Pantheon, ‘M. Agrippa L. F.,’
omitting, as he usually did, his ignoble gentile name. He obtained
three consulships, of which two were consecutive (see 1. 3, 7), and the
honour, said to be unprecedented, of the ‘corona classica' (Vell. 7. 81,
7). He was also the first ever admitted to share the tribunician power
of the princeps (see 3. 56, 3). He was first married, probably in 718,
Μ. 36, to Pomponia, daughter of T. Pomponius Atticus the friend of
Cicero, by whom he had Vipsania Agrippina, married to Ti. Claudius Nero
(see B, note 7). Pomponia, if still alive, must have been divorced when he
married Marcella in 726, Μ. 78 (Dio, 53. 1, 7), who in her turn was
given up in 733, Μ. 21, to enable him to marry Julia (Dio, 54. 6, 5).

5. A (5). Julia was married at the age of fourteen to Marcellus, in
779, Μ. 75, and four years later to Agrippa, who was of the same age
as ber father. On other projected marriages for her, see note on 4. 4ο,
8; on her subsequent marriage in 743, Μ. 77, to Tiberius Nero, her
exile in 757, n. c. nand her death in 767, Μ). 74, see 1. 53 ; Suet. Aug.
65, 66 ; Tib. 50.

6. A (6). On Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar, see 1. 3, etc. Their
honours and titles are gathered from Mon. Anc. (ii. 46, etc), and from
several inscriptions (Orell. 633-644). Gaius was pontifex, augur, consul
(754, nn. 1), princeps iuventutis, and imperator, apparently for the capture
of Artagira (Henzem p. 60). Lucius was augur, cos. design. and princeps
iuventutis The betrothal of Lepida to him is mentioned in 3. 23, 1.
A long inscription is preserved ,recording the honours paid to the
memory of both princes by the magistrates and citizens of the ‘colonia
Iulia Pisana' (Pisae in Etruria), of which they were patrons (Orell. 647,
643). The dates of their deaths are from Insc. Orell. 644. .

7. A (8). On the younger Julia, her exile and her death, see 3. 24, 53
4. 77, 63 Suet. Aug. 64, 65. Her husband was son of the censor Paullus
and Cornelia, and thus grandson of Scribonia (see note 3). Her son,
M. Lepidus, a man of most profligate character, was put to death by Gaius,
who bad previously given him Drusilla in marriage. and meditated desig-
nating him as his successor. See note on 14. a, 43 Dio, 59. 77, 6.
