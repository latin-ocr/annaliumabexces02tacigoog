considers it a point of patriotism to conceal the number of Roman
slain. This retioence, observable throughout his narrative, especially in
the account oi the campaigns of Germanicus, appears to have been
deliberately adopted as a principle, aud grounded on precedent, in a lost
part ol the Histories ¹.

The second exception relates to the practice, so common among
ancient historians, and never regarded by them as a breach of truth,
of composing imaginary speeches purporting to be historical². There
is, however, reason to believe that Tacitus recognized some limit in
this respect, as may be seen hythe comparison elsewhere made between
the speech assigned to Claudius on the concession of full citizenship to
the Gauls³ with the extant fragments of the actual speech ⁴, which would
lead us to conclude, that in such documenta as the recorded letters and
speeches of the princeps to the senate, Tacitus while feeling at liberty
to condense, rcarrange, and generally to deal with the form as he
thought lit, and to assimilate the style and language to his own for the
sake of literary homogeneity ⁵, does consider himself under an obligation
to preserve the substance of what was really said, and that such passages
are, to this extent, historicall: though a much smaller measure of truth
may be supposed in less known or less famous senatorial speechesl ;
and still less, or rather none, in such orations as those of Calgacus to
his countrymen⁸, or iu the address of Germanicus to the mutinous
legions, or that to his friends around his death-bed⁹.
