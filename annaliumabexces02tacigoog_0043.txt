26 INTRODUCTION. [cmv. tv.

speaking generally, we find that Tacitus disdains all notice of adula-
tory writers; the contrasted opinions being generally more or less hostile;
that he only names his chief authors where they disagree¹, but that he
sometimes checks them by other sources ², and does not always follow
the same authority in his earlier and later works ⁸.

The points os contact between Tacitus and Suetonius more numerous
in the earlier⁴ than in the later Books of the Annals ⁵, and far more so in
the Histories than in either ⁸, do not decide the question whether the latter
author used the former or both followed'a common source ². On the
whole, the differences arc far greater than the resemblances, as might be
expected from the individualities of the writers, and from the different
point ol view of a biographer and a historian. Suetonius probably used
more numerous sources ⁸, but took only what suited him from each.

In the case of Dio, even where some direct use seems indicated ⁹, the
question is complicated hythe long interval os time, allowing the snp-
position that he may have known Tacitus through intermediate works¹⁰.
We should not suppose that the writer ol a complete Roman history
could use many sources sor any one period, but it is to be noticed that
he often gives particulars omitted by Tacitus and sometimes adopts
a different scale of proportion ¹¹.
