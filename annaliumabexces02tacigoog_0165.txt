was sufficiently secure at the outset to have made it their best policy

calmly to bide their time lor a succession which every year of experience
and public lise would have the more assured to Nero: we can also see
that Seianus had an obvious motive for iusidious attacks on them; and
may even have forced them to intrigue in seli-defense: and that, with or
without such incentivos, the fiery and domiueering nature ol Agrippina¹
may have made her play only too readily into his hands.

These causes at any rate tended to promote the ascendencyol the only
real minister whom Tiberius ever irad. It is by playing on these weal-
nesses that Seianus is represented to have induced him to taire the great
step which marks the close os this period; that ol permanently withdraw·
ing lrom Rome ¹, and fixing his headquarters in the natural island·
lortress ol Capreae ⁸. Accepting, on general authority, the counsel ol
this adviser as the primary motive sor such seclusion, Tacitus adds, with
perhaps more than due stress, others which we may place in the second
raulr ⁴. The dictation still exercised by Augusta, even at the ageos
eighty-five, is intolerable to an almost septuagenarian son, and amounts
toa virtual claim to share the power which she had won for him. His
habits os lise are said to have driven him to fly the restraint oi society:
even his personal appearance to have led him to shun the eyes oi uren.
The tall gaunt lorm, awkward even in its erectness‘, has contracted an
ungainly stoop; the countenance, so refiued and distinguished in his
busts and coins, is said to have become 3 loathsome spectacle. What·
ever may be the explanation or excuse, the lact itsell remains that for
the last ten years ol his rule he withdraws srom all publicity, lrom all
personal intercourse with the senate and almost all with its magistrates,
and that the accessibility and civic lite hitherto associated with a Roman
princeps pass into the seclusion ol an Easteru sultan.

The period which begins with the concentration ol a body-guard
seems aptly to eud with almost a sels-imprisonment: aud we appear to
see 3 picture, neither inconsistent nor indistinct, of a phase intermediate
between bis best and worst; one oi an old age os increasing timidlty,
