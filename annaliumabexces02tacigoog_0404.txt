ΟΝ THE CAMPAIGNS OF GERMANICUS.

Trru geography aud details of these operations have been explained in
the notes, so far as they seem to rest on trustworthy evidence3 and it is
here intended to give only a brief sketch of the general plan of campaign
and its results ¹.

The disaster of Varus, if really decisive as to a policy of conquest,
could not be at once accepted as such without provoking German
aggression3 and even a ¹ bellurn abolendae infamiae'' would be popularly
understood to require some recovery of lost ground. The army was
consequently at once made up to eight legions, and placed for three
years (763-765, au· 10-12) under the supreme command of Tiberius,
and for four more under that of Germanicus, who had previously served
one year (764, an. ιι) under his uncle.

Beyond the Rhine all was lost, except in its lowest course, where the
Batavi and Frisii remained subject, and at least an outpost was held
among the Chauci ³. The camps at lloguntiacum and Vetera formed
the base of operation against the chief hostile tribes, the former against
the Chatti of Hessen, the latter against the Cheruscan confederacy,
which, though extending to the Rhine, had its beart far away beyond
the Weser. ⁴

Of these the Chatti, though before and afterwards by far the most
formidable enemies of Rome in Western Germauy ⁴, and highest iri

military organization⁶, seem¹ at this date lrept by their standing jealousy
of the Cherusci⁶ from giving effectual aid to the national cause. They
