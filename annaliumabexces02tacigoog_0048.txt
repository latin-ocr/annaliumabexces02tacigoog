destiny are mingled and confused ¹, and the latter appears often to mean
no more than the operation of some inexplicable cause ³, or sometimes
only tlmt which would happen in the ordinary course of nature if men
made no etlort to supersede it¹. When he has to explain the steady
career and position of a Manius Lepidus, he feels that it must be due not
altogether to destiny, but in part at least to his own persona} qualities ⁴.

On the whole, his doctrine has thus neither the precision nor the
embarrassing consequences of a philosophical theory, and is rather such
as would be expected in one who held that, while a tincture of dceper
studies formed part of necessary culture ⁸, it was not welf for a Roman
senator to go too far in thern‘. His creed serves him at times to point
a moral, rather than affects his general view of historical events ’.

Writing with a moral purpose, it is needless to say that Tacitus holds
himself bound to tell the truth without prejudice or favour ⁸. That he is
no careless follower of previously written narratives has been already
shown’; while the accuracy in detail, both of himself and his informants,
is in no slight degree evidenced by confirmatory inscriptions, such as those
already cited ¹⁰ ; aud by the paucity and insignificance of such errors of
factas have been clearly brought home to him ¹¹. What is probably the
weakest point in his narrative, the wantos precision in its geography¹²,
is a defect which he chares with Livy, Sallust, and other authors, who
bave had to describe military movements on an extensive scale without
the aid of maps ¹⁸.

Two points may here be noted, in which this obligation to veracity is
consciously relaxed.
