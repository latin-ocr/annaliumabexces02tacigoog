exisfing, purporting to be only the latter hall of its original butkt,
appears to have been brought to Rome to Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici
(afterwards Leo Χ), who a lew years later entrusted·its publication to
Beroaldus, in whose edition, published at Rome in 1515, these Books
appear lor the tirst time among the works ol Tacitus ³.

There are some discrepancies as to the circumstances ol its acquisition,
and neither Fulda nor Hersleld, but the monastery oi Cdrvey, in West·
phalis, is mentioned as the place ol its discovery ³. Bandini had assigned
it to the eleventh century, but recent scholars think it as early as the tenth
or even the ninth ⁴, though there seems to be no evidence for Ritter’s
view that it is the same MS. known to have existed at Fulda. An
excellent lacsimile ol the first page oi Boolr 111 is given by Vitelli and
Paoli‘‚ and a photographic reproduction oi the first page ol Book I in

Μ. Hocbart's work ¹.

The text, at various stages ol its derivatim, has sometimes suffered
from a misleading hali-knowledge, and more seriously‚ at a later date,
lrom complete ignorance ol Latinity, added to carelessness ol eye or
ear, in its copyists, whereby words have been mutilated and wrongly
divided, letters mistalien or transposed, syllables dropped or assimilated
to those next to them, glossas have crept into the text, or ‘lacunae'
- have passed unnoticed ⁷.

These errors had not wholly escaped the old revisers, whose erasures,
linear and interlinear corrections, and dots placed above or below letters
to be expunged, are now carelully noted ⁸.
