1.Α(ι). Tur family history oi the Octavii, with further account oi the
father and mother oi Augustus, is given by Suetonius (Aug. 1-4). The
distinctions ol his iather are enumerated in an inscription (Orell. 592),
which states that he was twice trib. mil, also quaestor, plebeian aedile,
iudex quaestionum, praetor, and proconsul oi Macedonia, where he
became entitled to the name of imperator. The date oi his praetorship
was 693, tte. 613 and he was presented irom becoming a candidate
ior the consulship in 696, nc. 58, by his death at the very beginning
oi that, or at the end oi the previous year.

2. Α(3). The frequency oi betrothal, and even norninal marriage,
during mere chiidhood‚ among Romans at this time (see Friedlaender,
Sitteng. i. p. 504, soll), makes it possible to reconcile some such a date
as that given sor Octavia’s birth with her betrothal or marriage to
C. Marcellus in 700, nc. 54 ; in which year it was also contemplated
to give her in marriage to Cn. Pompeius (Suet. Jul. 27). Marcellus, who
was a leading opponent oi Julius Caesar, but subsequently reconciled to
irim, had just died when Octavia, with contempt ior all usual decorum
(see Dio, 48. 31, 3), was hastily married to M. Antonius in 713, nc. 41,
by one oi tlte articles ol the compact at Brundusium. On the honours
pald to her at her death, see Dio, 54. 35, 4, on its date Suet. Aug. 61.

3. A (4). Octavius assumed the name oi C. Julius Caesar Octavianus
in consequence oi his adoption by the dictator's will: hence Cicero
styles him ‘C. Caesar' in official language (Phil. 5, c. 16-19), and some·
times in private letters ⁴ Octavianus’ (ad Att. 16. 18, r ; tt, 6, etc). On
the subsequent history oi his names and titles, see vi. p. 75, foll. He
had been lirst betrothed to a daughter oi P. Servilius isauricus ; aster·
wards, on his first reconciliation with Antonius, to a step-daughter oi the
latter, Clodia or Claudia, daughter of Fulvia by P. Clodius. His marriage
with Scribonia tras contracted in 714, nc. 40, to conciliate Sex. Pom·
peius, whose father-inlaw, L. Scribonius Libo, was her brother. She
was much older than Octavianus, had been twice previously married,
