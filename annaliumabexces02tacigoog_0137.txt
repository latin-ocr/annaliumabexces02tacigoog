Asia¹ were such as could hardly have been exceeded under the Re·
public: in the same province, within the next ten years, another pro·
consul² and a procurator’ are convicted oi extortion3 and moconsula
ol two other provinces⁴ are condemned on equally serious charges:
nor does Silius come with cleaner hands from Germany': iu Spain
a legatus is assassinated through some money grievance‚ oi which we
have only the Roman version⁸z the Frisii are goaded into rebellion
by the exactions of a subordinate officer²3 and the chief Gauiish tribes
driven to the same course by a load oi debt⁸, probably not uuoou·
nected with ruinous requisitions ior the wars oi Germanicus': Pontius
Pilate uas allowed ten years oi misgovernment in Judaea ¹⁰: and fuller
records from the provinces themselves would probably have shown
many other such hlots on the administration, under even one oi the
most frugal and vigilant of the Caesars ¹¹.

With the provinces should be enumerated the semi-independent states
and kingdoms, whose position must have varied greatly. Some viere
small sree states, as Samos ¹⁸, Rhodes ¹⁸, Lycia “3 analogous to the many
sree cities within the provinces. ln others the prince had the title oi
‘praelectus’ (as Cottius ¹⁸), or the position in fact (as Herod and his
sons) oi a procurator¹‘; or may have been under a similar control to
that exereised over the Thracian princes ¹⁷. Juba and his sons iu
Mauretania¹⁸‚ and the princes leit in Cilicia¹⁰, may have been free
lrom other obligations than to iumish troops on demand ¹⁰. The Cap·
padocian king was even iiable to be brought before the bar oi the
senate ²¹. The relation os Commagene is unknown ¹¹. Beyond this
the Armenian kingdom and the smaller Caspian principalities” seem
to have accepted a kind oi Roman suaerainty as their best protection
against Parthia. in all these, complications vvere apt to arise demanding
the interposition ol the Roman govemment. Rulers set up by Rome were
naturally unpopular‚ and their subjects showed their insubordination as
