delect in his authors, from the faint interest taken even in what they
might have known. Men were ‘ignorant os politics, as being no business
ol theirs¹' but that os their rulers. Whoever has taken notice of the
‘indiligentia veri’ possible. even now, under circumstances of the utmost
publicity and lullest extension ol public responsibility, even among poli-
ticians and political writers, on such public affairs as do not touch them
immediately, will appreciate the prolound truth ol this remark ol Tacitus,
at a time when neither such publicity nor responsibility existed.

Lastly, Tacitus divides all the chroniclers under the principare ², or at
least all the successors os the great historians of Augustus ⁸, into two
sharply-contrasted classes, the one, of those who wrote to datter the
ruling prince, the other, of those who poured out their pent-up rancour
aster his death.

We need not assume that each prince had his chroniclers of both these
classes. In the case ol Tiberius especially, it has been already noticed ⁴,
that (except the sew pages ol Velleius already mentioned) no historian
is known even by name to us, as having published any account os the ‘res
Tiberii,' ‘florente ipso ⁶.’ Without assuming that none existed where
none are known tous, we may reasonably suppose that few, it any, cared
to publish contemporary history under a prince whose aversion to
flattery is stated to have been at least as great as his sear of lreedom⁸3
while the subsequent rule of the son, brother, and grandson os Ger·
manicos lest abundant opportunity sor the multiplicatiori ol virulent
attacks on the great reputed enemy ol that house.

We are really no less in the dark as to those who may have written on
Gaius, Claudius, or Nero, ‘florentibus ipsis '; but it is obvious that the
same historiari may have belonged to both classes in different parts os
his narrative ⁷, even il he could not change sides on the same prince with
the versatility of Seneca ⁸. · ⁸ ·’
