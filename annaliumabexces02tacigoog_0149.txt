Many obligations, not easy to specify ln their places, must be bere aclrnowledged to
several works, especially that of Professor Gemite: but my chief endeavour hus been
to give an independent judgment on the facts and interpretatione of facts containedin
Tacitus and other original authorities

Tactuus would undoubtedly wish bis readers to take, as his most
deliberate judgment on Tiberius, the summary at the end of the Sinth
Book, where his life is marked out into perlods, showing a gradual
moral deterioration‚ affecting both his private habits and personal
govemment ¹. It will therefore be convenient to examine these suc·
cessively.

Ι. ‘Egregium vita famaque quoad privatus vel in imperiis sub Augusto
vixerat!

This emphatic praise, from so unfavonrable a witness, though perhaps
qualified by insinuations of latent cruelty', and tales, which we seem
intended to believe, of a foretaste at Rhodes of Capreae ³, must at least
be taken as an admission that his public life to his fifty-sixth year was
unimpeachable, and seems to carry with it a disbeiief in the tales of
drnnkenness caught up by Suetonius ⁴.

‘From earliest infancy‚ his lot was one of peril ⁶.' Born in the
year of Philippi⁶ (712, nc. 42), he shared in the very beginning of life
the hurried flight of his parents from Perusia: he was only four years old
when his mother became the wife of the triumvir; only nine' when his
father's death transferred him to tbe tutelage of his stepfather, who two
years later became the undisputed master of the Roman empire. From
this point, his life, in the judgment of popular exaggeration, seemed

enviable in the extreme. He is ‘brought up frona childhood in areigning
family, loaded with consulships and triumphs in his youth ⁸.' To amore
careful observer, the thirty-five years next ensuing are ahistory of
barassing intrigues and rivalries’ and souring disappointrncnts, hardly
compensated by ultimate success.

He assumed the ‘toga virilis ' in 727, nc. 27, and by special privilege
