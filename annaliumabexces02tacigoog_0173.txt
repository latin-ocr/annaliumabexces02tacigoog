When, ior instance, we are given to suppose that Tiberius at the age ol
nineteen had almost saved Rome from lamine as quaestor¹; and at Ι
twenty-five had virtually subjected Armenia and terrified Parthia'; ve
are iorced to ask how much similar exaggeration may lurlr in the history
ol the German and lllyrian campaigns. Sometimes, too, this rhetoricis
confronted by stubbom realities. Against the alleged all but complete
subjugation oi Germany⁸ must be set the lact, that the single deleat and
annihilation ol a force os some 30,ooo men rolled back the tide of con·
quest lrom Germany, not temporarily, but ior ever. The account oi the
passionate enthusiasm, with which the legions are said to have welcomed
Tiberius ou his return ⁴, must be read in the light oi our knowledge that
his name ten years later had assuredly no magic, either sor veteran or
recruit, among the armies that had known him best Even Julius Caesar
had to face the mutiny ol a legion; but popular generals have not ollen
been met by the wholesale defection ol their armies ⁸.

ln the notice by Velleius oi this principate‚ we have no right to expect
details from a sketcb os sixteen years contained in eight chapters; yet his
suppressions at times are most significant. Four years had passed since
Tiberius had permanently lest Rome⁶3 yet his retirement is not even
glanced at. On all the state trials os these years, we have only a line in
reproach oi the crimes os Libo Drusus, Silius, and Piso'; and a hint
oi the shamc and sorrow supposed to have been lelt at the conduct
ol Agrippina and Nero⁸. We seem forced to conclude that on these
subjects the silence ol Velleius is more eloquent than the epigrams ol'
'l'acitus⁰. Are we prepared, again, to taire his verdict on Seianus as well
as on his master? to see in him the Laelius to this Scipio, the Agrippa
or Statilius Taurus to this Augustus ¹⁰? The impression leit upon us
becomes on the whole that oi a fairly skillul apology‚ saved from palpable
falsehood by ignoring what it is difficult to defend, and laying stress upon
what is undeniably praiseworthy.

On other authors less need here be said. No critic will expect to lind
truth of value in the lew scattered allusions of Valerius Maximus ¹¹. Philo,
