mitior quia toleraverat¹:' ‘acerrima proximomm odia¹ :' ‘causae in·
imicitiae acriores quia iniquae³:’ ‘proprium humani generis odisse
quem laeseris⁴'—these and a hundred such are the forms in which
the stern and bitter experiences oi the historian’s lile express themselves.
There are no such arrows in the quiver ol Augustan literature; they are
hardly so barhed even in Juvenal. Again‚ we have the satiric tendency‚
prevalent especially in the liuhais, to take extreme acts as typica} ol the
man, and extreme men as typical os the age. Not, however, that such
exaggerations are on one side only: the great literary artist knovs too
well the effectos aheightened contrast to neglect the opportunities held
out to him. Even on such neutral ground as the subject os the
‘QQL this is thought to have affected the historical fidelity oi

“ffactrus ; aud in the portraiture ol Rome under the Caesars, the tempta·
tion was lar more irresistible. Hence the eilort to idealize a Germanicus,
a Corbulo, or an Agricola, and others who might be mentioned; and the
tendency to surrouud with glory the death-scene ol the martyrs.

virtues, the neutral multitude ol ordinary men on the dead level ol

the Homeric armies.
