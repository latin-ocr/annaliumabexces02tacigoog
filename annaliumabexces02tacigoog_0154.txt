petuity, was still sormidable while he lived, and might any day retum to
favour ¹.

Augustus again, while addressing Tiberius by letter in a lulsome strain
of palpable exaggeration2, is said to have osten jested to his courtiers
about the poor Roman people, who were to be ‘so deliberately masti-
ested ; ⁹ ollen to have broken oli lively conversation at his approach ³, and
even in a public rescript to have ‘taunted him with his personal peculi·
aritiee under colour ol apology ⁴.' The epigrammatists who did not spare
Tiberius evenas a prince ⁵, assuredly did not spare him all this time· ; and
esen a posthumous stroke was dealt in the will which made him principal
heir, by a pointed allusion to those who should have filled his place ².

Such circumstances acting on such a temperament, produced much
such a character as we should expect. We are to think ol the man
Tiberius as one naturally austere, reserved, and distant⁸; the best ol
whose lile had been spent in camps or in retirement; whose position at
court had been generally more or less overshadowed by rivals; and
whose domestic lile had been wrecked lor political objects in which he
had no primary interest; while he had been schooled lor years in repres-
sion and disguise, with fatalists always at his elbow to tell him that his
day ol revenge would come⁹. He had lived in the coldest shade ol
neglect, as well as in the lull sunshine os flattery, and could rate the
homage ol senate and people at its proper worth ¹⁰. Os all views ol h's
character, none is more amply borne out by facts than that which states
that bis resolution was as weak as his penetration was keen ¹¹3 so that,
the more clearly he could read men's minds‚ the more he was at a loss
to deal with them. It is in this mixture of strength and weakness¹¹, as
well as in the union ol his natural sels-distrust¹³, reservo, and austerity,
with the souring experiences os a liletime, that we find the leading traits
ol character ol the luture rul'er.
