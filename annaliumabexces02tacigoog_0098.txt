cm.vr.]c0NsrlrtJT10N OF THE EARLY PRINCIPATE. 81

Claudius vras the first to take the name ol ‘ Caesar,’ to which he had no
family claim, as a name oi the princeps and bis house.

It has been seen that the term ‘princeps’ in itseli implied no
monarchy. or even magistracy; but in iact stood lor a combination ol
magisterial powers, so as ιο he contrasted as a kind oi greater magistracy
with the office ol consul, praetor, or aedile ¹. The boast ol Augustus, that
his eminence in rank gave him no more power than his colleagues in
any office ¹, cau only apply, even in the letter, to such a case as that oi
his consulships, and has no meaning in relation to the most essential
powers ol the principale, the ‘proconsulare imperium' and ‘tribunicia
potestas-J in which he had, as a rule‚ no colleague. , Νοι were these
powers confined to their original limits, but received great successive
extensions by steps not now always traceahle.

1. The ‘imperium' commonly called ‘proconsulare ³,' is the most
essential element ol his power. ‘Imperium’ had always necessarily
belonged to some definite magistracy, and at the first settlement in 727,
sc. 27, and lor lour years afterwards, Augustus was continuously
oonsul; whence it is probable that the power exercised by him during
this period was no other than the ancient supreme ‘imperium' oi the
consuls over all other authorities at home and abroad⁴, coupled with the
assignment oi a ‘provincia’ embracing all the most important portions
ol the empire. On bis permanent deposition oi the consulship in 731,
ac 23, a more lormal definition of the ‘imperium' still reserved to him
was required, and we find ironr ennctments passed in this year and
shortly afterwards ⁶, that besides the command, which would bave
becorm proconsular, ol the Caesarian provinces, certain powers, differing
from those oi ordinary proconsuls‚ and distinctly consular, were expressly
reserved to him, namely, an ‘imperium maius' over all governors of
provinces, even those appointed by the senate, and the retention ol his
‘imperium' in Italy and even within the pomerium ol Rome ⁸, besides
