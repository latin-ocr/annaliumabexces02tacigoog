262 P. CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [auena

Arminius, quot patibula captivis, quae scrobes, utque signis et
aquilis per superbiam inluserit.
62. Igitur Romanus qui aderat exercitus sextum post cladis
annum trium legionum ossa, nullo noscente alienas reliquias an
‚asnorum humo tegeret, omnes ut coniunctos, ut consanguineos
aucta in hostem ira, maesti simul et infensi condebant. primum 2
extruendo tumulo caespitem Caesar posuit, gratissimo munere in
defunctos et praesentibus doloris socius. quod Tiberio haudti
probatum, seu cuncta Germanici in deterius trahenti, sive exerci-
ιο tum imagine caesorum insepultorumque tardatum ad proelia et
formidolosiorem hostium credebat ; neque imperatorem auguratu
et vetustissimis caerimoniis praeditum adtrectare feralia debuisse.
