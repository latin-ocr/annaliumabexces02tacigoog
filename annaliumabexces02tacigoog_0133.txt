oi the troops, and perhaps also some territorial government ¹.

The Caesarian provinces¹ can be classiiied in three ranis, of which the
two first answer to the two classes ol senatorial provinces3 the legati
being in the greatest provinces always of consular, and in those oi the
second class, oi praetorian rank ¹; although, in recognition oi the ‘pro-
consulare imperium’ as vested in Caesar, all have the uniform title oi

‘legati Augusti propraetore,’ and the same insignia ol five fasces, with the
military dress and sword *ς their difference ol rank being only noted by

the addition ol their titles oi ‘vir consularis ¹,' by those who were such.
To the highest class belong all those provinces involving important
military commands; ol which the following had been established at the
death oi Augustus¹z 1. Hispania Tarraconensis; 2. Germania superior ;
3. Germania inleri0r¹3 4. Pannonia; 5. llloesia ; 6. Delmatia (or lllyri-
cum) ¹5 7. Syria (with Cilicia) ¹. The second classes constituted at the
same period, will comprise: 1. Lusitania; a. Aquitania ; 3. Gallia Lug·

dunensis; 4. Gallia Belgica ¹¹; 5. Galatia ¹¹ ; 6. Pamphylia. Α third class
of provinces had no higher officer than the ‘procurator Augusti,’ who
appears as a subordinate officer in greater provinces ¹¹. To this class
belong at this time ¹¹: 1. Alpes Maritimae; a. Raetia3 3. Vindelicis ¹¹;
