. they were hurried away to their island prisona, and, about a year later,

the second son, Drusus, was consigned to a dungeon in the Palatium ¹.
The goal at which Seianus was straining seemed within view3 yet, iu
spite of all the honours which he was allowed to enjoy or hope for, his
triumph was incomplete‚ and his position insecure, for Tiberius character·
istically stopped short when his mind seemed made up. More than two
years passcd⁹ before the exile of Nero was followed by his execution or
compulsory suicide⁸3 Agrippina and Drusus still lived on; Gaius wasiu
favour, and was pointed out as heir⁴ ; Seianus was not yet united to the
house by marriage, nor colleague in the tribunician power. Tiberius
was never wholly blinded ; and from his natural temperament, when
other causes of apprehension were removed, could hardly fail to suspect
the minister himself. Hence the conspiracy to destroy Tiberius and
Gaius is represented as a desperate stroke in aelf-defence. The plotter
had however met his match ⁶, and fell with a crash to which Dio could
find no parallel till the fate of Plautianus in his own timei

Seianus has not generally found favour even with the defenders of
Tiberius, but has rather been made the scapegoat of his prince. He
represents no doubt a period in which, from growing distnrst of the
nobility, Tiberius bad resolved to throw himself on the support of ‘novi
homines,’ and his portrait is such as aristocratic painters draw'. Yet
it is admitted that his influence was, at least at the outset, good⁸ ; and
that his fall was at least as great a calamity aa his ascendency’. And
when we ask definite questions-Did he poison Drusus? Did he bring
about the retirement to Capreae? Did he compass the fall of the family
of Germanicus? Did he conspire against his master’s lifel-we see
that the positive evidence is weak. The first charge, testing, it would
seem, only on the evidence of tortured slaves ¹⁰, was preferred eight
years afterwards by Apicata, whose knowledge could but have been
at second hand¹¹, and who had every motive for aiming a deadly blow
at her rival Livilla, ata time when any genuine investigation was im·
possible. On the second question, we have the doubts of Tacitus
himself, who suggests other motives for our consideration ¹². On the
