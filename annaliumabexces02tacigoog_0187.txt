ment and recall oi Agrippina (note 14), 6111 was soon after againbsuished
and put to death at the instigation os Messalina, Dio, 60. 8, 5. Sue·
tonius (Cal. 7) mentions the death in childhood os three other children oi ’
Germanicus and Agrippina, born apparently in the years 761-764, Ab·
8-11 ; and inscriptions are found recording the place ο1 their cremation.
One oi thern appears to have been called Tiberius, another Gaius (Insc.
Orell. 668, 669, 67ο) 11 is also stated by M. Seneca (Controv. 4) that
Quintilius Varus (see on 4. 66, 1) was a son-in·law oi Germanicus; but

it is not known how this was the case. On the probable birth ο1 another
child, see note on 1. 44, a.

17. 11116). Amarriage had been projected in 715, nc. 39, between
Marcellus and the daughter os Sex. Pompeius. His marriage with Julia
daughter ο1 Augustus took place in 729, nc. 25 (Dio, 53. 17, 5), 111 which
year Plutarch states (Ant. 87) that Augustus also adopted him ; 6111 11111
statement appears to require confirmation. He had been admitted to
the senate with praetorian rank; but his first and only actual magistracy
was the curule aedileship‚ held in his twentieth year, which was also the
year ol his death. See 1. 3, 1; Propert. 3. 18,13-1ο; Verg. Aen. 6.
861-884.

18. 11117). 11 is known that there were two ‘Marcellae' (Suet Aug.
⁶33 Insc. Henaen 5373, 5374) and that one ol them, generally taken to
be Marcella minor, was married to Agrippa (see note 5) and to lullus
Antonius (see note on 4. 44, 5). That the other was married to Μ.
Valerius Barbatus Appianus and to Sex. Appuleius, is a supposition to
explain the relationships mentioned in 4. 52, 1; 2. 5ο, 1; where see
notes. Nothing appears to be known ο1 1116 date oi birth or death ol
either sister.

19. 8118). Suetonius states (Aug. 63) 1611 Agrippa had children by
Marcella. That one oi these was a daughter, probably another Vipsania,
and was married to Q. Haterius, is an inference iromthe nanneni
Haterius Agrippa, and lrom the mention made (a. 51, 1) ol his relation·
ship to Germanicus.

20. A (29). Tacitus twice (4. 44, 3 ; 11. 64, 4) speaks ol the wile ol
Domitius as ‘Antonia minor ;' 6111 Suetonius (Cal. 1; Cl. 1; Ner. 5)appears
to be right in assigning this marriage to Antonia maior, andin making
Antonin minor the wilc oi Drusus. 'The marriage with Domitius (ort
whom see 4. 44, 3 ; Suet. Ner. 4) is said to have been projected as early
as 717, nc. 37 (Dio, 48. 54, 4); 11 which tirne it would appear lrom
dates surnished by Plutarch (Ant. 33, 9303 35, 931) 11111 the elder
Antonia was butan iniant, and the younger yet unborn.
