procurators abroad began by being iar less than they ultimately
became ¹.

Thus the two classes ol magistrates coexisted: and a similar duality
pervades the whole govemment. We have the two classes of provincial
governments; the senatorial proconsuls, appointed by lot, with annual
tenure 3 and Caesar¹s legati and procurators, specially designated, and
continuing during his pleasure. There are two judicial systems; on one
side the consular-senatorial high court, the tribunale oi the praetor and
iudices, and ol the centumviri; on the other, tlre personal court oi the
princeps and those ol his delegates. There are two hessones, each oi
which receives and expends public money¹ ; even two coinages, as the
princeps coins gold and silver‚ and the senate copper ³.

In some departments, indeed, oi the thus divided govemment the
senate has, in outward show, more even than its old constitutional
power ⁴. In sorm, since the abolition oi the comitia, it elects the magis·
trates of the state, who, through such election, themselves becom
senators3 and its decrees gradually take the place oi formal laws⁶. In
form, again, even the choice ol a princeps rests with it. ln several other
departments, its format powers, it not increased, are yet retained ⁸. The
domestic history ol this period is still mainly a record oi its debates and
decisions; nor is the right to express opinion limited strictly to the
question before the house l. Formaily‚ again, it is still the iountain ol
honour; triumphs⁸ and triumphal insignia ⁰, days ol public rejoicing¹⁰
and other compliments to the ruling family ¹¹, public lunerals¹⁸ and
other memorials to the dead ¹³, are awarded by its decree. By its decrees,
again, vices ¹⁴, disorder ¹⁸, unlawiul religions¹⁸, are repeatedly rebuked or
dealt with.

Still more remarkable is the institution and development at this time
ol the senatorial high court oi criminal judicature¹⁷, whose proceedings
occupy so large a space in the history of this period. lt may not im·
