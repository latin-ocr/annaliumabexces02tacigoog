θωνα] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΑΝΙ) TIBERIUS. 101 ,

Tiberius is also specially recorded to have considered nobility os ancestry “ ’ “
in his award of honours ¹. Consequently, we still find under him not 3j:
only the Aemilii Iepidi¹ 3ηά Calpurnii Pisones³ holding their heads
almost as high as under the Republic, but also many other time-honoured
names frequentin high positione, such as those oi Aurelius Cotta ⁴,
Cassius longinus ⁸, Cornelius Lentulus ⁸, Cornelius Sulla Felix ⁷, Do·
mitius Ahenobarbus ⁸, Furius Camillus ⁹, Junius Silanus ¹⁰, Mamercus

Semnan, Scribonius Libo ¹¹, Sulpicius Galba ¹³, Valerius Messalla ¹⁴, 3ηά ’.

ancestors surrounding their 31113111η 3ηά paraded at their sunerals¹‘; ,

and even their unworthy members seem to have retained no small share ’

oi popular reverence ¹¹. Side by side with these are the houses that had ¹J .
come to the front in the revolution, as the descendants os Agrippa ¹⁸,

Pollio ¹⁹, and Taurus ²⁰, or those since ennobled, as the Vitellii ²¹ ; while

a Sulpicius Quirinius²² under Augustus, or a Curtius Rufus²³ under ’ν
Tiberius, are examples os menos the people rising to rank by personal Δ
energy. Such decay os old families as belongs to this stage, seems thus '

to be traceable to little else but their own hideous gluttony and luxury ²⁴,
3ηά munus ostentation²⁵ ; to their vast parlrs 3ηά villas which helped to
make the sood ol Italy dependent ou wind 3ηά wave ¹⁸, 3ηά which had
seemed, even iu the time oi Horace, to be crowding the‘fish out ol the
sea and leaving on land sew acres sor the plough ¹⁷.

It must be borne in mind that senatorial families must have ranged in
walth from the bare census ol 3 million H.S.'⁸, exceeded by many
knights and even sreedmen‚ to the 400 millions ol 311 augur Lentulus '²’.
The greatest, with their vast estates and slave-gange in Italy 3ηά the
