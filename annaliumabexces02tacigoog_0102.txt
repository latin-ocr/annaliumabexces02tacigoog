canava] CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLY PRINCIPATE. 85

and the personal sacrosanctity attached to it, we can readily under·
stand that it was regarded as in some respects more important than even
the imperium, and is described by Tacitus as a ‘title of supremacy
devised by Augustus, to make him pre-eminent over all other authorities,
without assuming the name oi king or dictator¹.’

111. The remaining magisterial functions are in their character chiefly
censorial or consular-censorial ¹. The censorship itsell lell into abeyance
from 730, rac. 24, till it was assumed temporarily by Claudius³ and
Vespasian ⁴, and for lile by Domitian ⁸. But Augustus makes use on
one occasion (726, u. c. 18) ol his consulship, and twice (746 and 767,
11. c. 8, 1. n. 14) ot' an ‘imperium consulare ⁰, to bold a ‘census populi,'
with which, on each occasion, a formal ‘lectio senatus' appears to have
been joined⁷: he also, though he refused the actual oliice of ‘ corrector
morum* no less than three times pressed upon him, certainly exercised
under another form, as did his successors alter him, some substantial
fonctions ol a⁴cura' or ‘praefectura monun⁸': it is also clear that in
particular, from and alter 745, a. c. η’, be revised annually the ‘album
senatorium,' and either then or as occasion offered, expunged names,
though perhaps only oi those who had lost their qualification lor that
rank ¹⁰. We also hear, during and alter this principate, os similar regular
revision ol the ‘decuriae equitum’ for judicial purposes¹¹, and ol the
‘turmae equitum equo publico ¹²3¹ besides special gilts or withdrawals
