It wne perhnpn from such biognphiefl that Tacitus enriched his
record os the soenes ol' the last yem ns Tiberim with cases unknown
ιο or unnotieed hy his usual authorities ¹.

Collections of lettersy similar to those ol* the younger Pliny, rnny
also tuve been tunde by public mern und the distinguished orators
of tlte period, such us Q. nater-tur ⁴, L. Arruntius ⁵, Domitius Μετ’,

spathe! '. The speech οῖ Ρ, Vitellius at the trial of Cn⁴ Piso* is
referred to hy the elder Pliny'.
