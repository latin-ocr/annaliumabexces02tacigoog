cutte] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. ‘117 ⁸

4. Noricum 5. Judaealnhen not under native princes)¹. The procurator
of Judaea was certainly in some cases responsible to the legatus of Syria ²,
and perhaps all such govemors were at first subordinated to their
nearest ‘legati' An exception to all these classes is the position of
Egypt, which although recognised in terms as part of the Roman Empire³,
and equal in population and military force toa Caesarian province of
the highest rank ⁴, was held by the emperor not as partos his dyarchy
with the senam, but as part of his own domain and as representative of
its kings, withan equestrian praefectus as vicegerent⁸; senators being not
only excluded from all office in it, but even forbidden to enter it⁰.

The governors appointed by Caesar held office during pleasure and
for no fixed term ⁷, though a periodos from three to five years seems
usual ⁸. Tiberius is especially noted forcontinuing them in office during
periods of indefinite length’3 as may be illustrated from such lists as
can be made of the govemors of important provinces during this period.

ln Syria we find only the following ¹⁰ :—

1. Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus Silanus, cos: 760, Α.ιι.7; legatus
Syriae from at least 763-4, nn. ro-rr ¹¹, to 7703 ao. 17¹².

3. Ι. helihs Lamia, cos. 756, no. 3 ; leg. Syr. for many years end-
ing in 785, nn. 32 ¹⁴, and possibly even the next regular successor
to Piso ¹⁸.
