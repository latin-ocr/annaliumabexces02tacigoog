Drusus Claudianus' (see Vell. a. 75, 3); and that oi ber mother aa ³
Altidia. Ti. Nero was quaestor, pontifex, praetor (Suet. Tib. 4), and
gave up his wife to Octavianus in 716, nc. 38, before the birth ni
Drusus He died when his eldest son was nine years old (lbid. 6)
Livia became by adoption in 767, nn. 14, ‘lulia Augusta, Divi Aug. ί·
(Insc. Orell. 615, etc.) Though not deihed at ber death (see 5. a, ι),
she became so alter the accession oi Claudius (Dio, 6ο. 5, a), and shared
atemple with Augustus in the Palatium (lusc. Orell. ²44⁶)· Evenin
her husband’s liletime she was entitled ‘Liria Augusti dea' in art in·
scription in Sicily (Orell. 614), and at other times received abroad other
titles not sormally allowed (see notes on r. ι4, 1); and her birthday

in Suet. Tib. 7; lnsc Orell. 658), see note 4. She was betrothed to
Tiberius Nero in infancy (· via annicula' Nep. Att. 19), but the date ol

‘Ti Claudius Ti. l. Nero,’ his titles being those ol his two consulates,
with those ol pontifex and imperator, and, alter 748, nc. 6, the years

becomes ‘Tiberius Caesar, Augusti l, Divi nepos' (Inse. Orell. 683),
but usually drops the gentile name Julius During his principue, the
