1. Iulia, the only child os Augustus.
On her marriages see Introd. ix. note 5.
All authorities are agreed upon her vices:

rogia. Some other sayings and persoual
trarts have been preserved by Macrobius
(Sat. 1. 3). She was fifty-three years old
at her death, ancl had lived tilteen years
iu exile, which at first was voluntarily
shared with her byher mother tDio, 11.).

19111101 the bay ol Naples. lt was alter·
wards the place ol exile 01 Agrippina
(Suet. Tib. 53), and 01 Octavia (14 63,
1). Julia was kept there five years, her
removal to Regium being a slight indul·
genoe (Suet Aug. 63).

Reginorum. The orthography ol the
MS. is confirmed by inscriptions (eg.
Orell. 3308, 3838, 811.) Nipp. notes that
the clause ‘qui . . . accolunt' is added
to distinguish it lrom Regium Lepidi
(Reggio), between Parma aud hlodeua.
Eauishment olteu took the lorm os restric-
tion toatown: cp. 13. 47, 4.

3. ruerat iu matrimonio, 810. On
her marriage to Tiberius, his retirement
to Rhodes, and the death 01 her sons, see
Introd. viii. pp. 133, 134.

4 inparem, ‘beneath her'; so ‘ma-
ternum genus inpar ’ (H. 1. 30, 1). Cp.
Sall. Jug. 11, 3; Liv. 6. 34, 9. In family,
'liberius was sar above her former hus·
barad, Agrippa, but had hardly as good
a position 111 the state; and her sons, as
adopted into the house ol the Cacsars,

and heus-designate oi Augustus, would
rank above her husband.

5. tam intima, ‘ao real! ‘Tam' is
used to add lorce to a superlative by eie,
as ‘tam gravissimis iudiciis' (Phil. 11.
3, 11) aad ‘ tam maxime ’ (de Am. 13).

7. etenum. Livy, in a poetical pas·
sage (9. 6, 4), adopts the Vergilian ‘om-
nium egeui' (Aen. 1. 599l3 and Tacitus
uses this poetioal word with genit. (us 4.
3ο, 1, 811), orabl. (as 11. 46, 1).

inopia au tabe longa, ‘ by privatiou
and slow decay,' ie. ‘ tabe per inopiam
iacta! Suetonius (Tib. 50) says that,
alter the death os Augustus, Tiberius
aggravated her restrictione, aad withdrew
her ⁴ peculium* and annual allowance.
Though she died within the ear, her
privations may thus have lastcd three 01
four months. At the time ol her exile
'liberius is described as 11 least out·
wardly acting with generosity 011 her
behall (Suet. Tib. 11).

8. loncmqmtata, ' datatim! She had
beeu torgotten so long that none would
asli how she died. his sense is fully
sup rted tcp. ‘longinquitas morbi’ Cic.
Phi . 10. 8, 16) ; and Ritter's reference to
6. 14, 4 hardly proves that uuy place
within Italy could be called ‘distant’

9. Sempronium Gracchum. There
is evidence (Fclrhel, v. 304 ; C. 1. L. vi. 1,
1515l that 1111 praenomen 1111’Τ111111111,’
and that he bad been ‘iii vir monetalis'
and ⁴ quaest. design.’; and Nipp. suggests
that he may be the same who is men·
tioned 11 a tragediaa by Ovid (ex P. 4.
16, 31), and ol whom three or tour lines
aud some titles are preserved by Priscian
and others (Ribbeck. p. 196).

10. prave facundus, ‘ ol uascrupulous
eloquence' : cp. ‘pudens prave’ t‘ with
lalse modesty ’1 1101. Α. P. 88.
