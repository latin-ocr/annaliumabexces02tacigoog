them stand on the delensive, and give no aid to those who give none to
thern ¹. With this exception, they are lest out os count, and the Upper
army is thus set free to join the other in the general attack.

Against the Cherusci and their confederacy Tiberius conducted at
least one campaign (764, ao. ιι), in which he is stated to have spent
sorne time across, but not sar srom the Rhine ¹, andis credited with much
the same acts of general devastation⁸ as are recorded ol Germanicus.
One expression (⁴ aperit limites ') would point to some more permanent
result, probably to the reoccupation ol the outpost ol Aliso ⁴, and the
restoration oi its communicatione with Vetera by a barricaded road along
the Lippe⁶.

Germanicus, on succeeding to the command, took no offensive action
during his first year, and seems to have planned none ior his second;
the rapid expedition against the Marsi late in the autumn of 767, an. 14,
being represented aa intended only to restore the morale ol the troops
aller the mutiny ⁸. Possibly he was encouraged'by its success, and
Roman opinion generally by an exaggerated report oi it ⁷, to look upon
reconquest as seasible; possibly Tiberius himself was inclined to a more
vigorous ellort to recover ground that he had done so much to win, than
the old age and infirmity of Augustus had been willing to sanction:
anyhow, the next two years show a really energetic attempt to regain the
frontier of the Elbe. Tacitus helps us little to conceive the plan oi

campaign ; but here, aselsewhere', some detail casually mentioned olten
helps us to see a meaning in what seemed purposeless; and we shall

hardly be wrong in thinking that the lirst object was to weaken the
consederacy in detail by bringing an overwhelming soree to bear on its
chief outlying members belore the centre was assailed. From this view
the already mentioned onslaught on the Marsi, who had been so
prominent as to have captured an eagle⁸, may be part oi a scheme.

The chiel campaign oi 768, an. 15, is, as we read it, an enigma,
