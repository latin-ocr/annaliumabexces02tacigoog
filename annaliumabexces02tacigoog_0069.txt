52 INTRODUCTION. [cnr. v.

34. 'Phe genitive of quality is used with the same brachylogy as tbe
corresponding abl. (i 29); so Lentulus senectutis extremae 4. 29, r;
velut eluctantium verborum 4. 31, 45 effusae clementiae 6. 30, 3;
ademptae virilitatis 6. 31, 3. Such brachylogy is also found in Caesar
and Livy. Dr. § 72.

35. Such genitives as morum r. 80, 23 flagitii 3. ao, 2 (where see
Nipp.); sui muneris 15. 52, 45 consilii G. 6, 63 also concise uses of the
gen. of sort, as Vannius gentis Quadorum 2. 63, 7 (where see Nipp.);
may be taken as qualitative, or may be referred to the class noted in i 32.

36. 'Phe olliptieal genitive ottho geruud is an idiom without real
parallel in any other author. The only instances are in the later books
of the Annals: nec grave. ..retinendi 13· 26, 4 (where see Nipp.);
penitus infixum erat . . . vitandi15.5,3; maneat . . . potentiam . . .
ostentandi 15. 21, 3. The gerund qualifies the substantival notion of
aburden (implied in ‘grave') or a custom (implied in ‘fixum' or
‘maneat’). Dr. i 2ο4, Kennedy 185. Some editors consider all three
passages corrupt.

37. 'Pho gerundivo genitive (see the corresponding dat. 5 22 b) is
used more frequently by Tacitus than by any other writer, and, in its
most remarkable forms, is especially characteristic of the Annals (Wblfflin,
Phil. xxv. 223). The usages may be thus classified t-

(α) In r'fs stinplestfhrm, ie r's parf of an ordinary define'ng geneiebe .· the
expressions ‘oratores pacis' and ‘oratores pacis petendae’ being equiva-
lent (see Roby, Pref. lxvii).

(b) tte gerunde'oe becomes a more essential part of the expression,
and, with the noun, fros the force os a gentisve os quality .· as ballum
abolendae infamiae 1. 3, 6; pecunia omittendae delationis 6. 30, 1. Cp.
3. 27, r, &o

(c) The expression above might be used predriote‘vely with ‘esse'
expressed (Liv.) or implied (Sall. Jug. 88, 4), or with ‘videri' as quae
conciliandae misericordiae videbantur rr. 3, 1.

(d) tte geneiebe qualefies the uvhole sentence (Roby 1288), as Aegyptum
proficiscitur cognoscendae antiquitatis 2. 59, r. Cp. 3. 9, 23 41, 45 r 3.
11, 2, dec. This usage, though found in Terence, Sallust, and Velleius, is
distinctly Tacitean by reason of its comparative rarity both before and
after him. It may be best taken as a Graecism, like nl ληστικὸν nudipes
τοῦ rdc προσόδους μᾶλλον ie'vor αὐτῷ (Thuc. 1. 4). Wblfflin would supply
the idea of a substantive, as ‘proficiscitur, quod (sc. proficisci) cogno-
scendae antiquitatis ctat? The gerundial gen. is rarely thus used, asin

3. 27, a.
