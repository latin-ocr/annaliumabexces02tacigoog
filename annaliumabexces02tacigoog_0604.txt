ferred through the agency of Cassius Severus ², caused him also to be
pronounced a public enemy⁸ and imprisoned in a chamber in the
Palatium ⁴.

Seianus had apparently reached the height of influence. Every order
in Rome eagerly set up his statues and sent deputations to him, and paid
to his name almost the same honour as to that of the prince; while
Tiberius constantly called him ‘Seianus meus' and spoke of him aa
his ‘particeps consiliorum ζ’ and had apparently affianced himto his
house bya betrothal⁸; but was perhaps already secretly meditating his
destruction.

The consulship removed Seianus to Rome, and it does not appear that
he ever again saw his master, who declined his visits on various pretexts⁸.
Outwardly he appears to have allowed him to receive more marks of
honour than ever, to have admitted him to a priesthood and to a share of
the ‘proconsulare imperium',' and even to have permitted the passing
of a futile decree, appointing him with himself to be joint consuls for five
years ¹⁰. Curtius Atticus, one of the ‘cohors amicorum' at Capreae ¹¹,
was struck down at the favourite’s instigation ¹¹ ; while other men of rank,
among them Fufius Geminus the friend of Augusta, met a similar fate ¹⁸.
Though he was not himself permitted to retain the consulship, his
position seemed further secured by the substitution soon afterwards of
Fulcinius Trio, one of his creatures; and, later on, the death of Nero ¹⁴
¹ seemed to show that the hesitation of Tiberius in dealing with this family
was at length overcome.

But the position of Gaius, who had been raised with Seianus to the
pontificate‚ and was generally looked on as the heir, still seemed un-
assailable¹‘; and several small indications of coldness or displeasure
