buildings, towering often seventy fect high ¹, where the ‘plebs' found such
lodgings as they could afford, and, in the labyrinthine streets of ‘vetus
Roma' before the fire of Nero², lived in probably even greater dis·
comfort than in the time of Juvenal ⁸. The plebs, however, hadita
many grades of position within its ranlrs. Many must have been only
barely below the equestrian census ⁴, and many others, if not, like the
senators and eq‘uites, great capitalists, must have earned in various ways
large incomes, in the thousand callings and trades of Rome. To this
class also belonged vast numbers, among freeborn or freedmen, of what
are now called the liberal professione. The schoolmaster, as Orbilius⁸

cases heneath the dignity of the great senatorial pleaders; many, if aot
most of the teachers of rhetoric⁸; lawyers evcn of such reputation as
Masurius Sabinus ', were still plebeians. Such again, probably not so
osten freeborn Romans as freedmen or foreigners, were the architecta,
sculptors, painters, and other artists, the musicians and players¹⁰, the
physicians ¹¹, and practitioners of the forbidden arts of astrology¹² and
magic. Another large class would include the inferior officials in the
public service, scribes, apparitors, attendants on magistrates, and many

other walls of middle-class life which cannot here be specified.

Below all these lay a great mass of poverty, ranging from those who
had more or less scanty or precarious eamings down to the beggars who,
as now, infested the public places. For all this poorer section, one so

large asto call itself as a whole the ‘plebs urbana¹⁸,’ such provision as
would answer to a modern poor law was made by the monthly corn dole

and other occasional subsidies ¹⁴. Also large numbers of the poorer and
