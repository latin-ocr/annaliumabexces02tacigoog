1. adsecuturum, sc. ¹ fnisse' 2 see la·
trod. v. 5 39.

qnantum, auswering to ‘tanto':
Driiger compares H. 2. 99, a ; Lis. 5. ro, 5.

a. corpus, &c Two distinct facts
are stated in one sentence: (1) that the
bod was stripped in the forum at hn-
tioch (cp. 3. 12,7): (τ) that the presence
of signs of poison was not clearly proved. ,

4. sepulturae =‘ cremationi τ cp. c.
83, 3, and ⁴ sepultum’ Liv. 8. ²4· 16.

veneficii signs According to Suet.
(Cal. 1) there were darlr spots ou the body
and fuam at the mouth, and the heart
would not burn. 'lhe latter point, ac·
cording to Pliny (N. H. 11. 57,71,187),
was insisted on by Vitellius at the trial,
aud met hythe defence that it might be
the result of a heart discsse.

6. interpretabantur. The present
could be taken either as referring 1ο the
opinions of historiens (Walther), or to a
still existing controversy (Phtzner, cp.
‘secutis temporibus' 3.19, 1); but with
that tense we should have also expected
‘constat' for ‘constitit’ The omission
of a syllable in this MS. is very common.

7. consultatum, &a It would ap·
pesr from this passage that the arrange·
ment by which, in case of sudden vacancy,
as under the Republica quaestor could re·

senators present, who, ss no oue could
represent the princeps. could in some sort
represent the senate, and, by a kind of
interregal authority, appoint a legatus ‘sd
iuterim! Sentius evidently meumes right·

ful legatus, and has command of the
troolps3 and Piso, in resisting him, commits
ctvr war.

umque sua All legati, including the
‘legati legionum' (cp. c. 36, ri, were ne·
cessarily senators3 and possibly some
other senmors were among the ‘cohors
amicorum' of Germanicus.

9. Marsum C. Vibius Marsus was cos.
suff. in 70, rap. 17. as is shown hythe
Antisn l(alendar (Heuzen ⁶44²³ C. 1. L.
x. 6639). He is mentioned again in c. 79,
111156·71,171715771111177
Africa see Introd. vij. p. 114. He was
afterwards legatus of Syria (rr. το, 1),
is known as a man of letters, ‘inlustris
studiis' (6. 47, 3), and may have been
oue of those to whom we owe our details
of the death of Germanicus.

On. sentium. By combining the frag·
ment of a Gabine Kalendas (Or. 644:
C. l. L. i. p. 473) with another inscrip-
tion (Orelli 3260; cp. Hensen, p. 316),
he can be shown to have been cos. suff.
in 757111). 4, and to have had the cog·
nomen ‘Saturninus‘ He is not heard of
after these events c.79.4; 81‚2; 3 7,
s); but a mutilat inscription found in
ibe province (Eph. Ep. v. 1336), describ·
ing liberius as ‘cos iiii' (1.1). 21-30),
preservcs ‘Saturninus Leg. C aes.,’ showing
apparently that this appointment was con·
firmed by Tiberius, and lasted at least
twoyears.

quaesitum, ‘the question lay'3 so
‘de principatu quaesitum’ H. 1. 38, 4.

το. condamm so ‘Varro . . . Silio
concessit' 3. 43, 4: cp. ‘vix Tiberio
concedere' (c. 43, 4) : the full expression
with ablative of the thing occurs in 11.
