in the first three Books, and reviewed at the beginning of tbe Fourth,is
at once that on which his information is most full, and his estimate most ’
questionable: the whole time being thus summarily dismissed, not as that
in which the purpose was most sincere, but in which the disguise was best
sustained.

The fact of generally just and moderate govemment is admitted and
indisputable. We are told of constant consultation of the senate, even
on matters not strictly belonging to their cognizance¹ ; and its chief
members are encouraged to discus-s, and rehuked for servility'; that the
office of the magistrates of the republic is respected ’ς the iaws, with one
exception ⁴, uprightly administered; that in the bestowal of dignities the
worthiest were selected; that Tiberius set an example of frugality, both
in the moderate size and number of his Italian estates, amid the vast villas
of the nobles ⁸, and in unostentatious management and retinue; as well
as an example cf moderatiori in conducting disputes with other citiuens

characteristics at home were accompanied by clemency and vigilance

adjusted with care and remitted on occasion; personal violence and
confiscation scrupulously avoided; cruelty and extortion in got-emota
duly punished; fiscal procuratorships conferred on men cf character,
even without personal knowledge3 and their tenure indefinitely extended,
as if to diminish temptation to peculation, by giving men time to grow
rich without it.

to believe that Germanicus, whose chief recorded achievements are those
of mere ravage and massacre ⁸, or ostentaticus and futile obsequies to the

limam of those who fell with Varus l, or at best barren victories in the
' eld', balanced by disastrous retreats’, and entailing untold requisitions
lon Gaul ¹⁰, was recalled from an all but completed conquest ¹¹.

The general foreign policy of sucha ruler naturally finds little favour
with an historian who looked bach with fondness to the military glories of
the old Republic ¹², and was writing when the star of conquest was again
in the ascendent, when the eagles had advanced to the Carpathians and
the Pruth, and beyond the Euphrates and Tigris, the fleet to the Persian
Gulfand the Indian Ocean. His disdain is natural for theold ‘narrow
