136 INTRODUCTION. [0111111111.

in case ο1 a sudden vacancy3 but who, altera sacrifice os the best years
oi his lise lor the ruling house, might expect to be summarily set aside
ior a youth, il circumstances herealter made it leasible. Such in the
earlier years was Agrippa, and such was in later times the position ο1
Tiberius. Each was victim in turn to the matrimonial arrangements
which Augustus always carried out with more than a Roman's disregard
ol natural affection, osten with a cynical contempt even lor common
decency ¹. Each had endeavoured to escape lrom an intolerable position
by retirement irom Rome '. Agrippa, had he lived long enough, would
probably again have had to retire besore his own sons, adopted into the
family ο1 the Caesars over his head. Tiberius, even at the death ol Gaius,
had Germanicus been ten years older or Augustus ten years younger,
would probably have been again postponed to the grandson ο1 Octavia,
whose children by Agrippina would still more nearly represent the true
blood oi Augustus³.

We may well believe that a sense ο1 public⁴ duty cooperated with the
solicitations ο1 Livia, in procuring the adoption of her son, which she so
osten recalled ιο him in alter times as the crowning service ol her litet
Still, with the tenacity that marked all his policy, Augustus seemed even
then to leave a chance open ior luture lamily schemes, not only by him·
sell adopting at the same time the worthless Agrippa Postumus ⁸, but
also by compelling Tiberius, as the price ol his own adoption, to adopt
Germanicus ⁷, and thus to prejudice the position ol his son by blood,
Drusus, who was a year or two younger. Even the prospect of a possible
civil war could not turn the old man lrom a scheme which might one
day bring back the inheritance ol the Caesars to his own direct descen·
dants. Hence the undisguised coldness ol Tiberius and Livia towards
Germanicus and his house, and the suspicions, not the 1111 real because
baseless, that the young man might 111111 his popularity to disloyal
