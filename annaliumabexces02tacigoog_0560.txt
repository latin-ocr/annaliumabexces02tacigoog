‘iudicium’ or ‘ius templi ' ; the question
mooted at the beginning 01 the chapter:
lor the phrase cp. H. 3. 7,1,Suet.C. 15,
Cic. and Liv. Bouudary stenes in accord-

belonging to this date, inscribed 'Opus

1. serariani . . . moutam apud ury-
oum. Segesta (the Greek Ἐγεστα) and
the mountain 01 Eryx were iu the nortb-
west comer 01 Sicily; the latter being iden·
tified with Monte S. Giuliano near Tra·
pani (Drepanum), and the ruins 01 the
forrner traceablc north-west 01 (3111111111,
west 01 Alcamo. The city 01 Eryx on the
slope 01 the mountain had been deserted
(Stmb. 6. 2,6‚ 171), probably ever since
its destruction by Hamilcar barca (Diod.
²3· 93 ²4· 8), and we gather here that its
territory had passed to the Segestana: but
the temple on the summit bad been 01
old (Thoe. 6. 46, 3), and continued to be,
very famous; and the goddess had also
under this title a ternple in Rome. The
torm ‘Eryeus' is found iu Cic. Verr. 1.
1, 8. 11; 47. 115.

form ‘dilapsam' is supported by H. 1.

3. da origiue. Both cities were in·
habited by Elymi, who claimed a T ro·
jan origin' (Thuc. 6. 1, 5). Segesta (the
Acesta 01 Verg. Aen. 5, 718) and the teru-
ple (ld. 759) boasted Aeneas as {eunden
the eponymus 01 Eryx was also called
1 son 01 the goddess (Id. ²4 aud 411);
whence both are connected nith the au·
eestry 01 the Iulii.

4. suscepit euram. According to
Suetonius (Cl. 25) the actual worlc was
carried out by Claudius, at the eost 01 the
seranum.

5. praees, i. e. that the will 01 Volca-
tius Moschus might be allowed.

Usually this 'ius exulandi’ obtained only
in relation to provincial states connected

note there. The date there given 01 his
consulship is consistent with his being

Several petty wars against Dacians on

01 Augustus (see Mon. Aue. v. 44, Gr.
avi. 11, and Mommsen there) ; and Florus
(1, 18) mentions the name 01 1 Lentulus
in connexion with one 01 them, which
Mommsen dates iu 759, Lu. 6. The
correction 01 Lips.‚ ‘Gaetulis’ would
identily this Lentulus with the elder
Gaetulicus (sec on c. 41, 5), who is
thought to haue lived to 1 later date,
aud to have been the ‘Cossus' who,
according to Seneca (Ep. 83, 13), sue-
cegded L. Piso (6. 10, 3) as praelectus
