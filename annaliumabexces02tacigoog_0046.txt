cmlv] TACITUS' thE OF HIS MATERIALS. 29

It is with these purposes that we are to suppose him to have dealt ι

with his materials3 on these that his sense of historical proportion, in the
topies made more or less prominent or wholly omitted, may be taken to
bc mainly grounded ¹. Even granting the defects incident to history
thus written for a purpose; his aim and range of subject elevate his
work above mere biographies, such as those of Suetonius. Much as all
history at such stirne must dwell on the personal qualities of the prince,
he has never made these his subject in themselves; but always in some
subordination to their effect on the personal govemment and admini-
stration of the empire. The designation of his work by St. Jerome‚
as 'Lives of the Caesars ²‚' needs but to be mentioned, to show its entire
inadequacy.

Yet again, the purpose in view alone justifies to himself, and is expected
to justify to the reader, the monotony of his theme; the weary record of
‘cruel mandates, perpetual accusatione, treacherous friendships, destruc·
tion of the guiltless’; forming ιιι his mind so painful a contrast to the
roll of foreign conquests and great domestic strugg oles which his prede·
cessors were privileged to unfold³. Much indeed that uould have been
far more interesting to ourselves has thus been sacrificed, but he is at
least eutitled to the credit of having adhered steadily to his plan ⁴.

The apparent inconsistency in the profession of a didactic purpose by
an author who inclines to fatalism, is to be met by shoning that the
opinions of Tacitus on this subject are neither so prominent nor so
definite as to malre such inconsistency palpable, aud that the saving
clauses in his creed evidently sufficed to prevent his being himself
perplexed by it.

The principal passage on the subject does not directly treat of the
fretdom of human action, but raises the question whether prosperity and
adversity and the chief occurrences of life are due to chance or fate ⁶.
