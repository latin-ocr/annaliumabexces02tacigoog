requiring military lorce ¹, with the legions stationed in them, are retained,
professedly lor ten years only² 3' while, in his horne government, Caesar
‘claims only to be consul, and to be satisfied with his tribunician right to
protect the people ¹.'

lt is claimed as proos os his moderatiori or discretion, that his con·
stitution made him not king or dictator but ‘princeps¹;' and he's
carelul to state that, while thus holding the first rank in the state, he
had no more power than his colleagues in any magistracy¹. This
appellation hasbeen commonly identified with that ol ‘ princeps senatus‚'
which had been some thirty-three years dormant; an honorary rank,
conlerring no other privilege than that ol being asked hrst, when the
consuls designate were absent. l'liat Caesar was ‘princeps senatus’
lrom the census-list of 726, nc. 28, to his death, is affirmed by him·
sels ¹: and such designationis the natural mode ol reminding senators
st each revision ol the list that he was one os themselves ¹. But, from
the earliest date, he is always spoken ol not as‘princeps senatus: but
as simply ¹princeps¹;' and speaks thus ol himself ¹. Also a saying
quoted ol Tiberius makes him express by that title his relation, not
to the senate, but to the citizens ¹⁰; and the earlier Greek writers render
the words by ἡγῳών ¹¹. lt is therefore probably to be considered as
aseparate designation, originating at the same date, which had become
conlounded with ‘princeps senatus' (τρόκριτοτ τῆς γερουσίας), by the time
ol Dio ¹¹. Such a term would seem to convey no more than the sacr
that Caesar was the soremost citizen ol Rome ¹¹3 and had been so used
ol Pompeius by Cicero ¹⁴ and Sallust ¹¹. Even long alter it had become
distinctive, it is still used inlormally by the elder Pliny ol Servilius

Nonianus ¹¹ 3 and at all times sofar relused to pass into a definite title,
