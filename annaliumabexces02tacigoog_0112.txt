to name no more nor fewer candidates than there were vacancies¹ ; and
thus to reduce the whole election to a sham; for, though the presiding
consul had probably power to publish a supplementary list ¹, those
‘nominated' by Caesar would be sure of preference. In the choice of
conmls this mode of induence seems to have been adopted. There is
no trace of formal ‘ commendatio,' or of special ‘candidati Caesaris' for
this office, but care secun to have been taken always to control the
electione by nominating only two candidates ³.

Again, candidates for the quaestorship‚ which gave admission to the
senate. must have been ‘tribuni militum,' or have served on the ‘ viginti·
viratus ⁸,' and had usually filled both positione. Of these qualifications,
the fust, as a military rank, could clearly be only obtained with consent
of Caesar ⁸.

Besides those entering the ‚senate through magistracy, others are men·
tioned in inscriptions, as early as the time of the censorship of Claudius
aud that ol Vespasian, as ‘adlecti a principe ‘,' and names were no
doubt added at the ‘lectiones senatus' held by Augustns'. Such
·adtecti’ have usuallya rank assigned as if they had been qualified by
office ⁸. The exclusion of senators on the annual revision of the list
has been already mentioned, as well as the constant control of that body
by the rights of ‘relation’ and ‘intercession ⁹ ς’ to which may be added
the power of preventing obnoxious senators from drawing lots for
provinces ¹⁰.

The duality of government is thus shown to be fictitious ; but it was
the policy ol most principes, especially of Augustus and Tiberius, to lay
‘public affairs and the most important matters relating to individuals'
before the senate, ⁴ to allow the chief men to debete, and even to check
their servility ¹¹! Besides the formal share of government already men·
