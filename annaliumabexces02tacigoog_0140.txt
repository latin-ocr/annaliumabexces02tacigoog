By the year 882, an. 69, we lind the number oi legions increased,
to thirtyone, in consequence oi the occupation ol Britain and other
subsequent erents3 but it is subsequently reduced to thirty. The· local
disposition is also altered by that time in many cases ¹.

The legion consisted, as at other times, oi ten cohorts, divided into
thirty maniples and sixty centuries¹; but we have no certain information
oi its numerical strength. The estimate oi 6100 loot and 726 horse
given by Vegetius⁸, would certainly not agree with that ol this time in
respect oi the ‘equites legionis,' who appear now to have only num·
bered 120⁴, nor is there any evidence that the first cohort was now, as in
the time oi Vegetius, twice the strength of the others ⁵. lfa medium
estimare ol about eighty men to the century be taken ⁸, the total strength
oi the legion, including its officers, its cavalry, and those in charge of the
‘ballistae' and other engines forming its train oi artillery', would amount
to rather more than 5000.

The old names ‘hastati' ‘principes' and ‘pilani‚' survive⁸3 and,
though no longer designating any difference os equipment, denote pre·
cedence in honorary rank. 'Each cohort contained two centurieS, or one
maniple, oi each of these; and the cohorts also rank in honour accord-
ing to their number. This hierarcby oi rank serves to place the sixty
centurione in a constantly ascending series; the maniple, rather than
the century, being the unit oi the legion, and being under the command .
oi the first oi its two centurions. The lowest centurion would thus be
tbe subordinate centurion oi the ‘hastati’ oi the tenth cohort, styled
‘decumus hastatus posterioris centuriae,' or ‘decumus hastatus posterior ;'
