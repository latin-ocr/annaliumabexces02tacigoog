excussus orv rna ‘Lex Parra ronrnnn’ (see 3. 25-28).

Nora-ln the preparation of this Excursus, little more has been done

tation on the origin and development of law in general, and of Roman
law in particular, is an evidence that he considered it to form an era in
legislation. Still stronger testimony to its importance is given by the
constant references to it in the Digest3 and the numerous comments of
the jurists on its provisions ¹, which have rendered possible such restora-
tions of it as have been made.
