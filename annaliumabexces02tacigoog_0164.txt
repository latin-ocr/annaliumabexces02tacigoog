cw.v111.] TIBERIUS ΛΝΒ HIS GOVERNMENT. 147

interposing to modily the proposed penalty ol death or stricter banish·
ment ¹, satisfied apparently with the conviction itsels.

Iastly, at the close oi this period, in the case os Titius Sabinus we are
intormed ol disgraceiul expedients to procure evidence ², oi a hurried
vote and immediate execution without trial, on the very opening festival
ol the new year, in obedience to a missive lrorn the prinae ³. There may
bave been more in the case thanis reported ⁴, but the ominous beginning
ol the terrible letters lrom Capreae must be noted here.

lniormers again appear to be more openly encouraged, sometimes
protected from just retribution in caseos ialsehood⁸, and secured of their
reward, even where condemnation was anticipated by suicide ⁸. Confisca-
tions also now begin to appear, and so sar bear out the imputation that
an appetite sor them has arisen ⁷.

Yet the candour oi Tacitus shows much of the better and greater side
of the character still remaining in the dignified address on the death ol
Drusus ⁸, energy in public business ⁹, prompt investigation os a crime ¹⁰,
strict repression oi a popular scandal ¹¹, resolute disdain ol extravagant
honours ¹², munifioeuce on occasion oi a public disaster ¹⁸. Much again ol
mere gratuitous insinuation may yet be cast aside: such as that he was
J'ealous ol honour paid to young Nero and Drusus ¹⁴; attended to public
business only to dlsarm suspicion 1“; refused a temple srorn mere mean·
spiritedness¹⁸ ; suppressed mention os military disasters because he dared
trust no one to levy war 17; end the like. The memoirs ol the younger
Agrippina are once at least¹⁸, and probably more than once ¹⁰, laid under
contribution‚ with other matter which must be received with much reservem.

Still, aiter all deductione made, there seems to be evidence that,
besides the increased sensitiveness to attach, already noticed, a change
is growing upon him, a consciousness of iailing powers²¹, in which even
the offer to resign may have been hals-sincere²², a growing dread oi
conspiracies and ol those in whose interest they might be supposed to
take place; whereby the house ol Germanicus, still in favour at the'
beginning os this period ²³, are on the brinlr of destruction at its close ²⁴.
How lar their conduct justified, or could be made to appear to justily‚
such estrangement, can be never known ²⁵. We can see that their position
