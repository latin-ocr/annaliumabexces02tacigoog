it we suppose his natural irresolution to have mingled with his disguise,
he would not be the only one whose seli-reliance had sailed him at the
crisis oi his fortunas: and oi the reasons given sor his conduct, two at
least are thoroughly substantial. As regards the armies, he certainly did
‘hold a woll by the ears¹,' whether he was aware os the actual mutiny or
not: and the constitution ol the principate, as well as the absence at thir
date ol any monarchical or dynastic tradition ¹, required him to secure his
position by laying all stress on the apparent lree choice ol the senate ⁸.
Another leading instance is sought in his whole conduct to Germanicus ⁴,
which again, even in its most questionable points, shows babitual irresolu-
tion rather than malice. The position in which Germanicus is found
at the death oi Augustus⁸ is strengthened rather than impaired⁴; he is
allowed to levy war in such mode and on such scale as he pleases; his
distinctions are more than equal to his deserts⁷; his recall, as has been said
above ¹¹, is justifiable. Yet it is but natural that the compulsoryadoption’
should rankle in a mind so disposed to brood on its grievanees¹⁰: and,
side by side with the confidence which Tiberius lelt when great armies
were under his sons ¹¹, might lurlr some distrust oi the young man’s po
pularity, and ol the masculine energy oi his wile¹’. Thus we discern
a motive lor sending him to the East, where the legions did not know
him, and lor replacing a legate so connected with him as Creticus Silanus ¹⁸
hy one who could be trusted at least to hold his own. Cn. Piso, again,
was much to bemistrusted. The proudest member ol one ol the noblest
houses yet lestu, he had spoken out in the senate ¹⁶, and had perhaps been
noted by Augustus as dangerous ¹⁸. Yet his wife stood high in the favour
ol Augusta ¹⁷, and he could hardly be passed over in the award ol pro·
vinces. lt is reasonable ιο suppose that the one mistrust was set against
the other, that he was to be some check on his young ·imperator¹⁰‚' who,
in turn, was ιο checlr him by an ‘imperium maius' on the spot ¹⁹. Such
