Gracchus with him ranlrs no higher than Saturninus¹; not even Sulla
or Pompeius had disinterested aims¹3 the dictatorship of the first Caesar
seems only to form part of the twenty years of anarchy¹. There are in·
dications enough that his view of Augustus was as different from that
of Vergil or Horace as his Tiberius from the Tiberius of Velleius ⁴.
The ‘weariness of civil strifet’ which had followed Actium was em·
ployed hy Augustus first to ‘secure his own ascendency‚' and then to
give ‘laws which we were to enjoy in peace and under monarchy⁸.'
From this time ‘the old morality disappeared in the revolution 3 rnen
cast aside their position of civic equality and looked for orders to the
prince⁷;' hence begins the servile age of sycophants and courtiers.
The restoration of the Republic is still so far conceived to have been
possible ⁸, that Germanicus and his father are imagined to have contern-
plated it ⁹, and popularly held to have been victims of their love of
liberty ¹⁰. The vices of the senatorial rule‚ the improvement of pro-
vincial administration under the empire, are ignored even at the mo-

be mainly responsible for the degradatiou which had changed the
senate that confronted Pyrrhus or Hannibal to that which had dragged
its own members to prison at the bidding ol Domitian ¹¹.

Our estimate must also take account of the author's literary ten-

dencies. In one sense, not the Annals alone, but all the works of
'Tacitus are satire; lor satire, in the various forms which it took under

Persius, Petronius, lllartial, Juvenal, was the chief literary force of the
agc¹³; and a writer out of harmony with the times of which he writes
had a whole armoury of sharpedged maxims ready to his hand. ‘ln-
