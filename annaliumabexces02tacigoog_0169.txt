cases of pardon¹ and acquittal²3 some escape by giving information¹;
others by adj0urnment⁴ ; or by being merely ignored‘ ; others receive
leus sentences than death⁶; in others the sentence is not stated²3 and
in all this crash prudent men, like Μ’. Lepidus ⁸, L. Piso ’, Aelius
Lamia ¹⁰, Poppaeus Sabinus ¹¹, can still bold their own in honour.

We have, indeed, a weary list ol victims, of whom about forty namet
are specitied ; who were either put to death or committed suicide before
the last extremity. Among them are Agrippina ¹¹ and her second son²⁸,
and her old enemy Plancina ¹⁴3 Tigranes, ending of Armenia¹⁸; the
distinguished senators Asinius Gallus ¹⁶ and L. Arruntius ¹²3 and otbers,
noble and ignoble, foreigners as well as native citizens. To these 111
addition must be made for such names as may hare been noted in the
lost part of Tacitus ”; also for the recorded execution at once of an
unnamed number, detained in prison as accomplices in the conspiracy of
Seianus ¹⁹. On this occasion, the ‘immensa strages' of Tacitus may
probably be reduced to the ‘twenty in one day' of Suetonius²⁰z but
when all allowance is made, probably not less than 80 lives in all may
have perished in thesin years’ reign of terror; for most of which the
responsibility must rest on the prince¹¹‚ though at the extreme end
hlacro appears to have acted in his master’s name ²².

Distinctions must be again drawn, as before. llluch noble and
probably much innocent blood was shed; but much that was noble was
probably not innocent, and much was neither noble nor innocent, but
that of the creatures of Seianus, who had staked their chauces on his
success. None need pity Latinius Latiaris ¹¹, Vescularius Flaccus’‘,
Julius Marinus ”, Fulcinius Trio ²⁸, or any others of the like description;
nor is anything recorded even of so prominent aman as Asinius Gallus,
or ol many others, which should make them deserving of special sym·
