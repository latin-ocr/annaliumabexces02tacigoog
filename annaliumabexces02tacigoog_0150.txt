1110 death 01 young Marcellus, who was about a year older, removed
the first 01 his various rivals from his path ¹. He was praetor in 737,
110. 17, 11 the age 01 twenty-five, and consul 111 741, sc. 13, at the age
01 twenty-nine ⁸.

Side by side with his advancement in civil 0111001 came a succession
01 military commands. After a‘tirocinium’ as military tribune in the
cantabrian war, he was sentin 734, mc. 20, in his twenty-second year,
with forces to the East, to give a king to Armenia; and had the honour
01 bringing back the standards lost with Crassus ⁴. In 732, 110. 15, he
shared with his brother Drusus the more arduous taslr 01 subduing the
mountaineers 01 the Grisons and Tyrol¹ 3 a service which probably gave
the youths their ‘nomen imperatorium ⁸.' About this time he received in
marriage Vipsania Agrippina, daughter, by a former wife⁷‚ 01 Agrippa,
who now stood next to Augustus as his son-in·law⁸ and his colleague in
the tribunician power ¹.

deeply attached ¹¹, and his marriage, 101 mere dynastic reasons, to Julia,
who may have courted him as a lover, but despised him as her husband,
and showed her contempt by her outrageous profligacy¹². Almost
