lt is not in the bare facts, which, as stated above, are rarely known to
be erroneous, and not often suspected of being so; but in the artistic
treatment of the facts, the brilliant colouring, the effective contrasts, the
dramatic situations, above all, in the subtle interpretation of motives, that
the injustice is mostly conceived to lurlr.

Again, the further he recedes from his own time, the greater, instead
of the less, becomes the suspicion of unfairness. His portraiture of
Claudius and Nero is less assailed than that of Tiberius, which, although
the most elaborate analysis of character in all his writings‚ is also most
often attached as untrustworthy.

It will be the work of other chapters to follow him in detail through
the whole period, and to point out such inconsistenciea and unfairnesses
as may seem traceable: but we may here notice such general considera-
tions as make it probable that he has dealt less than justice to the early
Caesars.

One chief cause will be found in the fact that in the Annals generally,
andin the early portion especially, he is beyond the limits of his own
knowledge, and forced to depend on written authorities; and in the
defects of his own and their methods of dealing with historica! evidence.

The Roman critical faculty, never so keenly en its guard against
inaccuracy in substance as against solecisms in language ¹, seems
generally to have spent the force of its historical judgment in dealing
with discrepancies between informants, without recognizing the in-
sufficiency of even their united testimony to establish what was beyond
their means ol knowledge. Such is the general attitude of Livy
towards his chroniclers; such again appears to be that of Tacitus
towards his ‘auctores' He could firmly reject a floating tale which
they had never recognized, and which was otherwise improbable¹; he
could supplement their defects in detail, judge freely between their
differences3 we can imagine him to have rejected, even in the face of
testimony,a statement evidently inconsistent with itself or exaggerated:
but where a story was generally accepted, and did not bear plain marks
of overstatement or incredibility ³, we cannot suppose it to have occurred
to him to ask whether its subject was one on which his authorities
were competent to speak. For instance, the details of a private cor· ’
respondence between Tiberius and Seianus are given without expressed
or implied suspicion §.though it appears to us almost impossible to
imagine authentic evidence of them.
