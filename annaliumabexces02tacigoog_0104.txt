cw.v1.]c0NSTITUTION OF THE EARLY PRINCIPATE. 87

who held the ‘imperium' of the state, and the authority of the senate

to ‘give laws' in its name ¹. Many such imperial ‘leges datae' are
mentioned· and fragments of some are preserved¹ ; many of them giving
colonial or municipal rights ³, or ordaining statutes for such com·
munities ⁴. Again‚ the citizenship, formerly given, as a rule, by plebiscite,
but often also through authority committed to commandere, as Marius,
Pompeius, ἃς), is now formally given by the princeps, both to in·
dividuals ⁴, usually as the reward of service in the auxiliary forces ⁴,
and also to whole communities⁸. The legal force of these edicts and
rescripta, though strictly limited to the life of tlte princeps, was in most
cases permanent through confirmation of his ‘acta' after his death.

Again, by his indirect and direct judicial power, he became practically
the sole fountain of justice. Besides framing the lists of ‘iudices
selecti⁴‚’ and regulating their duties ¹⁰, Augustus had, in 726, ac. 28,
‘and often afterwards,' selected the ‘praetor urbanus' ‘extra sortem ¹¹.’
The princeps frequently sat as assessor at the praetor's side ¹⁴, and even
in absence appears to have been treated as present by the fiction of
a ‘calculus Minervae' deposited in his name¹³. Tiberius constantly
presides in person at the senatorial high court of justice ¹⁴, induencing
it by his manner ¹⁸ no less than his vote3 and enercises his power of
intercession, whether in refusing to admit the case¹⁴, or in modifying
the sentence, either at the time ¹⁷, or before its formal enrolment ¹⁴. The
power of pardon‚ vested in some form and to some extent in every
magistrate ¹⁴, and substantially reserved by the old constitution fortite
people²⁴, has now, so far as it exists, passed directly or indirectly to
Caesar ⁴¹, as in some sense their representative.
