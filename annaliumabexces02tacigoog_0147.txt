have been steadily extending itself. By the manumission of slaves,
which, in spite of checlts imposed upon it, must have been constant, any
Roman could call into existence those who at a stroke of the vrand
succeeded to most ¹, and whose sons would succeed to all, civic privileges.
Many a Roman pauper by transplantation to a colony became there the
parent of a prosperous civic family. lllany an auxiliary soldier, already
habituated to Roman customs hy service under the standards, received
the civitas on his discharge ², and his sons might serve and rise in the
ranlts of the legions and thus lay the foundation of a career of honour.

Lastly, in spite of the vast diversity of tolerated religions, some traces
of common religious ideas begin to develop themselves. The restora-
tion of religion had formed a great partos the policy of Augustus, and
his aspiratione are devoutly seconded hythe poeta of his court ⁸. Besides
the rehuilding or restoration of almost every temple in the city ⁴, he had
endeavoured to bring-home religion to the mass of the people hya kind
of parochial system, in tlte worship of the ‘Lares compitales' at the 300
chapels⁸ instituted in the various vici, under the ministration of their
sreedmen priests l‘Augustales’), and superintendence of the ‘vicoma-
gistri ⁶.' With these the worship of his own ‘Genius’ was associated⁷‚ by
which constant usage, as well as hy tlte ‘ludi compitalicii ⁸,' the political
order was connected with the sacred ideas of domestic security; not
only in Rome and Italy, hut in many parts of the empire ’. 'l’o this was
added afterwards throughout the empire the later cult of the ‘Divus
Augustus ¹⁰¹ and his deified successors; as also in some cases, that of the
living Caesar, associated with the imperial city ¹¹: the whole forming altind
of apotheosis of order and peace, which appears to have been fortite
present the nearest approach to an universal religion.

Otherwise there was more interchange than fusion of manifold reli·
gions. Temples to Jupiter Capitolinus are found in provinces ¹¹; and, in
turn, whatever was attractive in provincial religione stmck root in Rome;
and supplied, what the colder forms of the state ritual failed to supply,
some food for the fervour of religious enthusiasm and for speculative
theology. lllany foreign religions obtained special licence, and even the
