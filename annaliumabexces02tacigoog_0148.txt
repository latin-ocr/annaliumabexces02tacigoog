illicit might enjoy practical impunity, till circumstances pointed attention
to them3 asin the suppression of Isiac rites by Agrippa ¹ ; or the stern
wengeance taken by Tiberius on the priests of this cult for a flagrant
moral scandal¹3 or tbe deportation of Jews arising out of agross pecu·
niary fraud⁸; the penalty being apparently in neither case such as sensibly
to abate the prevalence of such worships ⁴. ·

Nor could any coercion keep out the forbidden mysteries of astrology'
and magie⁶; the former of which had the direct countcnance of Tibe·
rius, though his protection of Thrasyllus· did not interfere with the
chawisement of the meaner herd⁷. The influence of all foreign super-
stitious ona less strong mind may be seen in the case of Germanicus;
in the restless search after foreign oracles, worships, miracles ⁸, which
seems to have so far guided his movements in the East 3 and in the
belief shared by his friends as well as himself, that the magician was as
capable of causing his death as the poisoner ⁹.

Meanwhile, the only religion capable of taking the place both of the
effere ideas of old Roman worship, and of the gross fanaticismsof foreign

superstition, was known as yet only to a few poor Jews, and hardly
reaches to the outer world till the time of Claudius ¹⁰.
