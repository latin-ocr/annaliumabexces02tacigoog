mutu] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 111

vtrh the Alpine pauses opening out regular communication with Gaul
and the Danubian provinces, secured by important towns, among which
Augusta Praetoria (hosta), at the meeting point os two great roads,
may be specially mentioned ¹. ln the newly won territory, Augusta
Uindelicorum (Augsburg) is an important centre of traffic with friendly
Germana in the time ol Tacitus ¹. Gaul owes to Augustus its organi·
mione the systematic census on which its tribute was pemranently
based⁴3 the constitution ol the diet oi the sixty-lour cantons³‚ and the
supreme position ol Lugdunum, and the worship ol the emperor there
established⁸.

In tbe eastern portion ol the empire we have no important conquests.
Thrace was still leit in what proved to be an unsatisfactory position ol
vassalage'‚ but the empire in Asia Minor by the annexation of the
dominions ol the Galatian king and ol Paphlagonia became acompact
territory extending to the Halys and Monnt Taurus ⁸, while the great
province ol Syria, except where it touched the Euphrates, was danked and
protected by vassal kingdoms '. To make the statement in the ‘Monu-
mentum Ancyranum¹⁰' correct, we should suppose also that the lrontiers
ol Egypt had been advanced at the expense of the Aethiopian aggressors,
and those ol Cyrenaica and Africa at that of the Marmaridae and
Garamantes.

ln tbe statement that at the death ol Augustus the empire was
bounded by the ocean or by distant rivers ¹¹, these provinces are left out
ol sigbt; but we know thatin the time ol Tiberius Egypt ended at
Elephantine and Syene ¹¹, and that the other African provinces must have
been always limited to the strip possessed by Hellenic, Phoenician and
