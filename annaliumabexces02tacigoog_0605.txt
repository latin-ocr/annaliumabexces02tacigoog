caused additional alann'. Becoming desperate, Seianus formed a con·
spiracy', in which many of all ranks joined, to assassinate Tiberius on
his return to Rome, and to contrive a similar fate for Gaius ⁸. This
appears to have been revealed by Satrius Secundus to Antonia, and by
her, through the agency of her freedman, Pallas, ιο Tiberius⁴ ; who was
nevertheless obliged ιο proceed with the utmost cantion, as he was
unable to reckon on the fidelity of the praetorians. A man of determined
loyalty was secured for the consulship in the person of Memmius
Regulus ⁸, and almost immediately afterwards the blow was struck.

The r8th of October· is marked as the day on which the famous
mceting of the senate took place in the Palatine Temple, at which the
‘long wordy letter from Capreae' was read. Naevius Sertorius Macro ,
had brought with him, together with this missive, his own appointment
ιο the command of the praetoriana, in which the soldiers were induced
hya liberal bribe to acquiesce. The ‘vigiles' over whom Seianus had
no influence‚ guarded the senate under their pracfect Graecinus Laco,
and led Seianus to the dungeon where he was on the same day exe·
cuted⁷. By subsequent sentences perished his eldest son ⁸, his uncle
Junius Blaesus ’, and others ¹⁰3 while many more were thrown into
prison to await trial.

Tiberius, who had awaited news of these proceedings in extreme
anxiety ¹¹, was soon afterwards filled with horror and indignation, on
a statement being made by Apicata, the divorced wife of Seianus, re·
specting the murder of Drusus, with the connivance of his adulterous
wife, eight years previously ¹². Livilla was put to death, or more probably
compelled to commit suicide¹·; and further investigations‚ conducted with
the utmost atrocities of turture, took place before Tiberius himself ¹⁴.
