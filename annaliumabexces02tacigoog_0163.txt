and in the severity ol sentences.

Many distinctions must however be drawn. Serious charges were

that the whole circumstances os the trial leit the accused no prospect ol
escaping condemnation but hy suicide.

Sometimes again conviction is alleged to have been entorced where

absurd in respect to some ol the persons implicated in them, and on
which the evidence is stated to have altogether broken down’¹. Yet
