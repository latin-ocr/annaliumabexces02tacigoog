and Gaetulian races.

The most pennanently important change dating from Augustus in the
administrationes the provincial empire is the division of it between
himself and the senate ¹. Out of the distinct govemments, about thirty
in number ⁸, subsisting at his death, only the following, and these not at
all times, remain in the hands of the senate: r. Sicily; a. Sardinia and
Corsica⁴3 3. Hispania Baetica3 4. Gallia Narbonensis; 5. Macedonia;
6. Achaia³3 7. Asia3 8. Bithynia (with part of Western Pontus);
9. Cyprus; ro. Crete and Cyrenaica⁸; rr. Africa (with New Africa or

’ Numidia). It has been mentioned above' that the governors of these
provinces were appointed usually by lot, with annual tenure3 Asia and
Africa being reserved for consulars, the others, as a rule, given to
‘praetorii3' but that both classes of governors are properly styled pro·
consuls ⁸, and have, as in old times, each his attendant quaestor3 and
also, in praetorian provinces one, in consular three ‘legati⁸;' who are
styled ‘legati propraetore ¹⁰,’ though sometimes even consulars¹¹. The
proconsul received a salary from the treasury¹¹ and had also the lictors
and other insignia of his rank, except the military dress and sword,
withdrawn to denote that he had no longer power to execute a soldier ¹³.
Some further check was placed on him by the presence of a Caesarian
officer, the ‘procurator fisci,' whose functions, originally strictly lirnited ¹⁴,
received such extension as to encroach considerably on those of both
quaestor and proconsul ¹⁸.

Some illustration of the mode of appointment to and tenure of these
proconsulates may be drawn from such lists as can be compiled of the
