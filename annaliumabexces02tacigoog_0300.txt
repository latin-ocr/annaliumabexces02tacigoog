to himself and Roma, at Pergamum in
Asia, Nicomedeia in Bithynia, Ancyra
in Galatia, and elsewhere (see 4. 37, 4;
Dio, 5¹· ao, 7), besides altars (see above,
also c. 39, r); but the example now set
may well have consisted in its being the
first national temple to ‘divus Augustus*
alone, and in the necessity imposed on
other provinces to aet likewise.
