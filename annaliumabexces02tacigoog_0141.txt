and the highest, the commender ol the maniple ol ‘piloni' in the first
cohort, who would be luily styled ‘primae cohortis pilus prior,' or more
commonly ‘centurio primipilus' or ‘primopilus¹.' In passing through
all these gradations, the centurion changed his century at each successive
step ¹, and in this highest position had custody oi the legionary eagle,
with large accompanying emoluments⁸3 ranked next to the ‘tribuni'3 aud
was admitted with them to the council ol the general ⁴. The centurione
appear to have still appointed their subordinate officeret but to hate
been themselves now directly appointed by the emperor, olleo ss
a personal lavour ⁸, and, apparently, without previous service ¹.

Augustus had perpetuated the custom introduced by the dictator
Caesar ⁸, ol placing the whole legion under the command ola ‘legatus'
These ‘legati legionum ⁹' are senators oi praetorian rank, or in a position
to expect such rank ¹⁰, and, as has been seen, ranked also as provincial
vicegerents under the ‘legatus Augusti ¹¹.’

The position ol the legionary ‘tribuni militum' now beconm some·
what anomalous3 inasmuch as they are no longer, as formerly, oom-
manders in turn ol the legion ¹¹, and several ol their other duties¹⁸ must
have been transferred to the ‘praelectus castrorum ¹⁴.' Nor do they
appear to have commanded the legionary cohorts, which, so sar as they
had a separate command, may probably have been placed each under its
first centurion ¹⁸. Such ol their duties as are still traceable can hardly be
generally characterized¹'; and this ranlr becomes hardly so much one
ol military promotion, as a' ‘ tirocinium’ lor young men ol the highest
families ¹⁷, and a stepping·stone to the quaestorship and senate ¹⁸.
