PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

—⁴0——

lu sending out, after nearly thirteen years' interval,
a new edition of this portion of the Annals, much of the
Preface of 1883 has to be repeated, with additional
acknowledgment of new sources of information since
that date.

The text is now that of Halm's fourth edition (188 3),
which has, however, been departed from in several places,¹
for reasons given in each case ¹. ln accordance with
several suggestions, Ι have now added brief critical
notes, which, it is hoped‚ will sufficiently show the
actual Medicean text, wherever it has not been retained,
and the originator of that adopted in its place, as well
as a lew of the other emendations proposed. For all
fuller information on this subject, the apparatus criticus
of Baiter (in Orelli's edition) and Ritter (1863) must be

text (Parker, 1869): they have been also specilied in
