Tacitus is himself our best authority· as ιο the offences origin-ny und
subsequently made indictable under (his term‘g which appears to have
been gradually defined, with iucreasing width, by the ‘leges' 'Appuleia'
(654, u-c. Ιοο), 'Vurin' (⁶⁶3, nc< 91), ‘Cornelia' (during «he rule of
Sulln)¹ and ‘Iulin' (enacued by Augustus)¹; und which, even in the [ime
ol' Cicero, has a formidably elastic meaning, which would hurdly require
pressing ιο make it cover the most “ming acts alleged to imply disi-espect*
or the slighoest approach ιο offensive words ⁷. This latter applicati->n is.
however, ει least extremely limitem until the time of Tiberius, under

more sweeping charum, was one which ἰι had been apparently thought
