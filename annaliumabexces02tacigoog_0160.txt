camvill] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 143

numerica! list oi such trials becomes considerable, when viewed in relation
to a period os prosound tranquillity and acquiescence; when, with in-
significant exceptions, the air is stirred by no conspiracies ¹, and the
nobles are servile, even to the disdain ol their ruler². We are sar
removed, both from such an open outbreak in the senate as that which
had forced Augustus to withdraw the ‘Lex Iulia maritalis ’ξ and even
from the independent attitude oi the Stoic aristocrats under Nero; and
the opposition has shrunlr into epigrams ⁴, the babble os ‘dinner parties
and places ol resort⁶,' ‘idle murmurs ‘,' ‘ whispers or suspicions silence⁷;’
in a word, into what no despotism has ever been able to repress, and what
no strong government need ever consider dangerous.

Nor are the charges in themselves so noteworthy as the accornpany·
ing growth oi an organized system ol delation, destined to acquire such
fatal prominence lor nearly a century afterwards. In Rome, at all times,
tbe absence ol a public prosecutor threw the duty ol accusation on
individuals⁸; and the desire to conduct a‘n impeachment was always
strong among Roman orators3 all the more so under the Empire, irom
the closing ol other roads to distinction, and the increasing prevalence os
rhetorical schools, in which the brilliant strokes ol a fashionable accuser
are held up to the admiration of the rising generation⁹. Even for men
ol rank and ivealth¹⁰‚ still more sor the needy and obscure ¹¹, sucha career
had thus manisold attractions. But Roman moral sentiment drew a strong
distinction between those who had a right to accuse or were deputed to
do so, and those who voluntered lor the duty and made it their professional
calling ¹²3 confining to the latter class the odious name ol ‘ delator ¹⁸!
