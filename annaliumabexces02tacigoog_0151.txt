place of Agrippa, by receiving for five years the tribunician poner3
a position which Augustus felt he could safely trust to one of such an
‘unambitious temperament ¹.'

It was now that he formed his strange resolution of retirement to
Rhodes. and with great difficulty obtained tbe neoessary permissioni
The conductos his wife is assigned as the most potent reason ⁸3 an in·
fluential second motive can be traced in the rise to manhood of the
young Caesare: and bis retirement of seven years is characterizedby
studious, not to say pedantic pursuits ⁴, and initiation by Thrasyllus into
the dangerous mysteries oi astrology, which toolr so firm a hold upon his
mind ⁸. After the banishment of Julia in 752, uc. a, he had desired,
but had not been permitted to return. The protection of his tribunicias
power expired‚ and the rest of his absence was a scarcely disguised
exile⁸ ; in which he was made to feel once for all that a private position
to one in such a ranlr was impossible, by being exposed to insuit and
even to peril of life, during the progressui Gaius Caesar to the Fast
under the sinister influence of M. Lollius ⁷. In 755, tun. a, the year of
the death of Lucius Caesar, he obtained leave to return to Rome ; but
lived in complete retirement till the death of Gaius in 757, no. 4, caused
a complete change in his position.

Now, at the age of sorry-six, he was adopted into the family of the
Caesare ⁸, his tribunician power was renewed for another five years ⁸, and
be was displayed as the heir before the greatest armies of the state ¹⁰. lf
we are to believe Velleius, he was welcomed hythe legions with raptures
of enthusiasm, and his achievements in the next seven years place him
in the front rank of Roman generals ¹¹. The aim of these military
operations was ιο complete the conquestos the great province in further
Germany, and to secure a frontier on the Elbe. In the two campaigns
of 757 and 758, ιο. 4 and 5, the resistance in North Germany appeared
to have been brolten; a third campaign was intended, by a concentrated
attaclt with twelre legions on Bohemia, to crush Maroboduus, who had
organized what might be called an empire of South Germany ¹⁸3 when the
