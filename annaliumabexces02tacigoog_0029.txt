Vettonianus¹ are names of persons employed in public service at a time
agreeing with that of their mention. None of these facts could have been
derived from any other literature known to us; all are confirmed by coins
or inscriptions of which Bracciolini and his contemporaries must have
been ignorant ¹.

lt seems hardly worth while to pursue this subject further. If it is
thus clear that the ‘Annals’ must have been written in ancient times,
when source-s of information now lost to us were in existence, and are
likely to have been written before the date of Ptolemy, we are entitled to
quote the testimony of Jerome‚ that Tacitus did write, in thirty Books,
the history of the whole period, or, as he expresses it, ‘the lives of the
Caesars‚’ from the death of Augustus to that of Domitian⁸; an arrange-
ment of books answering to that of the second hledicean MS, which
contains material purporting to be transcribed from an original of the
date an. 395, or contemporary with Jerome ⁴. Also on this view the
resemblances in Sulpicius Severus ⁶, Ammianus ⁸, and other writers will
rank as copies not as originals, and such knowledge of these Books as
is shown in the Middle h ges becomes relevant ⁷, especially the grounds for
thinking that a hlS. answering generally in contents to the second Medicean
was known to Boccacio, who died before the birth of Bracciolini ⁸.
