enavit] RouE UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 105

many atro of the better classes got what they could from the position of
clienta of noble houses. On the ‘clientela' under the empire most of
our information is of later date3 but it would seem even from Horace
that the old ideas¹ and old personal relation of elientship¹ had passed
away, and that already great men had their ostentatious crowds⁸ of such
dependents Still Augustan literature kuows nothing of the scramble for
the ‘sportula’ or the ignominious position of a Trebius at the table of
ι Virro.

Side hy side with the rapidly diminishing ‘plebs ingenua‘' was the
swarm of freedmen. Most of these were probably still outside the pale
of the tribes ⁸, and none had yet the political and social position in which
this class are found a generation later ⁶. Even at this date there are
those whose wealth at least might vie with that of the nobles ἵ, and great
numbers must have belonged to professions or callings requiring high
education and earning high payment. The remainder probably swelled
the ranlrs of the client-class. Augustus endeavoured both to limit
manumission by enactment and precept ⁸, and also to utilise freedmen in
the service of the state 3 in which they formed the bullr of the ‘vigiles ’ξ
and were even drafted wholesale into the legions after the catastrophe of
Varus¹⁰; while under Tiberius a large number were deported to be
made useful or left to perish in Sardinia ¹¹, and a law was passed to define
the status of a class of this order ¹².

Any numeriosl estimate of the ‘plehs urhana’ with their wives and
families rests almost wholly on guessworlc. We cannot tell how many
of the suburban or even nearest rural population may have helped to
swell the numbers of the aoo‚ooo recipiente of public corn under
Augustus ¹³, or the 25o,ooo to 300‚ooo sharers in his occasional ‘con-
giaria¹⁴.’ Itis therefore not surprising that calculations from such
triber (the richer 'tribules' being 'The wealth of Licinus underAugustus
