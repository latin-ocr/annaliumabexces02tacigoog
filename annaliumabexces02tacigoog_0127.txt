tharso cautious a ruler concentrated his attention here, and disregarded
the Parthian and British projects oi his uncle ¹. lt is here that we stud
his chiei achievements, balanced it is true by his one disastrous iailure.

When the empire carne into his hands Rome had not iuli access eren
to the Alpino passes; on the southern slopes of which were still
mountain tribes who plundered the Transpadana ¹, and when pressed teti
back on their brethren on the northern side; in the Greek peninsula the
Romans were hardly masters oi the Balkan (Haemus) and had little
more os Illyricum than the borders oi the Adriatic ¹.

lt is impossible here to trace the steps by which, mainly through the
instrumentality os his trusted iriend and nonin-law Agrippa, and of his
stepsons Tiberius and Drusus, this state ol things resulted in a succession
oi new provinces, Vindelicia and Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia,
all testing on the natural frontier oi the Danube, now ior the first time,
and almost sor its whole course, made a Roman river.

Westward, the aim proposed, and with some exaggeration claimed aa
realised, was the establishment oi an ocean frontier froin Cadia to tlte
mouth oi the Eibe ⁴. The main portion os this was completed by
Agrippa’s slow subjugation ol Spain ¹, and it is undoubtedly true that tor
twenty years a province oi Gennany irorn the Rhine to the Elbe was in
existence, which, notwithstanding the disaster oi Varus, Augustus stili
allects to regard as ‘de iure' Roman soil. Even alter its abandoument,
it is the military rather than the political irontier which recedes to the
Rhine ¹, and considerable territories on its right bank still are Roman¹ ;
and it is possible that the debateable land' called the ‘agri decumatea’
afterwards enclosed in the well-known ‘limes' connecting the Rhine and
the Danube, may have begun at an early date to be occupied by Gauls
under some sort oi Rotnan protection ’.

Upon the conquesta followed a great work oi organisation and
settlement, which can be' only briefly glanced at. The great roads
ol Italy, themselves thoroughly restored and extended ¹⁰, are connected
