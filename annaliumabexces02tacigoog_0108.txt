‘marcessiot’ Oi the quaestors‚ two are charged with communication
· between Caesar and the senate¹ ; four, until the time of Claudius, have
‘provinciae’ in Italy'; one is attached to each consul⁴3 one accom-
panies the proconsul to each senatorial province ⁶. This office would be
always keenly sought', as admitting to the senatorial rank with all its
duties aud privileges; the praetorship and consulship, again, would be
the highest objects oi senatorial ambition, not only as adding to the
'nobilitas’ ol families, but as stepping·stones to provincial govemments3
the praetorship to those ol the second rank, the consulship, both to the
greater Caesarim provinces and to the great senatorial prizes ol Asia
and Africa'. On the other hand, the offices oi aedile and tribune,
though one or other seems usually to have formed part oi the ⁴ cursus
bonorum⁸,' had so lar fallen into disrepute‚ that properly qualified
candidates were apt to be wanting '. The lesser magistracies, held
before the quaestorship, and often collectively designated as the ‘viginti-
viratus¹⁰‚' consisted os iour separate boards. (ι) The ‘tresviri capitales'
vere still charged with the duty of executing capital sentences, buming
books, &c ¹¹3 but their summary jurisdiction at the Moenian column ¹⁸

soon probably wholly or mainly passed to the praelectus urbis. (a)
The ‘tresviri monetales,’ or ‘tresviri aere argento auro flando seriundo'

must have had their office restricted to the copper coinage still struck by
the senate. Their names disappear irom the coinage srom and aller
the later years oi Augustus¹³. (3) The ‘quattuorviri viis in urbe pur-
gandis’ appear to have been subordinate officers to the aediles ¹⁴. (4)
Tbe ‘decemviri stlitibus iudicandis‚' a very old separate board, became
now presidente ol the centumviral courts ¹⁸. lt is evident that all these
greater and lesser magistracies filled considerable departments os the
home govemment3 and it is also known that the concurrent, and, ulti-
mately, encroaching iunctions ol Caesar's ‘praelecti' at home and
