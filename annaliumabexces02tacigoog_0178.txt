CHAPTER IX.

GENEALOGV 01² THE FAMlLY OF AUGUSTUS AND OF THAT
OF THE CLAUDlAN CAESARS, WITH NOTES.

orno to constant intermarriages between members os the imperial
family, the relationships between many ol the persons whose names
occur in these rables are extremely intricate, even without considering
tlte further complication introduced by adoptions. Thus the children
ol Germanicus are on their mother's side direct descendants ol Au· ’
gustus, and on their lather's side direct descendants ol Octavia, as well
as descendants ol the Claudian house. The emperor Nero, besides
pastaking ol all these relationships through his mother, was also directly
desoended srom' Octavia on his lather's side. All the descendants ol
Drusus, brother ol Tiberius, trace a similar descent through Antonia;
tlte children ol Drusus, son ol Tiberius, become menrbers ol that
family through Livilla; and the children ol Claudius by Messalina are
again through her father and mother doubly descendants ol Octavia.
Tiberius and the two Dmsi‚ his brother and son, are thus the only
memhers ol the Claudian stoclr who stand in no blood-relationship
to Augustum and Stem B might have been almost wholly included
under A.

It is hoped that the arrangement here adopted will indicate intel·
ligibly all the relationships ol consanguinity. Ol the adoptions, the
most important to bear in tnind are those ol Octavius by the will ol
Julius Caesar, ol Tiberius by Augustus, ol Germanicus by Tiberius, and
ot' Nero by Claudius.

lt is impossible here to speak ol the multitude ol representations
existing in art ol most ol the principal persons here mentioned;
specimens ol which most students must have had more or less oppor-
tunity ol inspecting lor themselves. For the benefit os those to whom
books are more accessible than museums, it is sufficient here to refer to
the numerous excellent illustratione and carelul judgment on the many
questions ol identity or ol apparent truth os portraiture in J J. Bernoulli’s
Rum'sclre Iconographr'e, part ii. vol. i.; and to the older bnt very beautiful
plates in the Iconographie Romaim os Visconti and lllongez. A still
