r. statuarsrat, ‘had flooded! The
verb is mostly poeticsl and post-Augus·
tan, and very rarely transitive. Cp.
(‘loca) stagnata paludibus' Ov. Met. 15,

‘relabentem' is aoristic (see lutrod. v.

two seuses, of the fall of buildings, aad
of mortality among human beings3 as
the stagnant water may hare bred a pes·
thence, which was the most usual occa·
sion for consultin the Sibylllne books.
In s similartl in H. 1. 86, 1, the
river is described as ‘strage obstantis
molis retusus: ‘strages' haviu its more
proper meaning of a confusedheap. Το

a miugled mass of building material and
human bodies was carried along with the

batur'; but it may possibly be meant
that such a mass 1011111011.ι i.e. was the
spectacle presented to view.

s. libri erbuurnt The new collection
of these prophecies, formed after the de·
struction of the old books with the Capi·
tollae temple 111 671, rac. 85 (Dion. Hal.
4, 61), had been revised by order 01
Angustus (see on 6. 11, 3), who placed
those a proved in gilded caslrets in the

destnl¹ of the statue ol Apollo iu the

elatine temple &huet Aug. 31). Tibe·
rius. annoyed at t e circulatiou of a pro·
fessed prophecy, is said to have ordered
a further revision aud the destruction of
the spurious (Dio, 57. 18, 4). On the
whole subject see Marquardt, iii. 350, 1011.

3. perinde. The combinatiou of this
word with ‘et' or ‘que'is Taciteau

diviua .. .obseeens. t fs an obvious
explanation. that he considered this a
case for the engineer rather than the
prophet. His fatalism (see 6. ao, 3;
Suet. Tib. 692f may also have influenoed
his refusal. bat be did, however, con·
sider the suppression of prophecy poli·
tically desirable, would appear from his

aetion (see above) respecting the Sibyl·
line prophecies, and also from his attempt
(see Suet. Tib. 63) 10 restrict the con·
saltatiou of ⁴ haruspices,’ and to abolish
all the eracles near Rome.

4. Ateio Capitoni. This grem jurist
(see 3. 70, 1; 75, 1) was ‘curator aqua-
rum,' in snccession to Messalla, from

Corinth. See Mar uardt‚ i. 330, foll.

Macedoniam. qThis country was re-
duced to a province in 608, rae. 146,
some twenty years after its submission.
It was separated by the Drilo und Mt.
Scordus from Delmatia and Moesia, and
by the Nestus from Thrace: its southern
liruits being the northern boundaries of
Achaia. Its chief cities were Thessa-
lonica and the colonies of Dyrrhachium
aud Philippi: Marquardt, i. 318.

levari . . . proconsulari imperio. lt
ls implied that the Caesarian goverument
was less costly. One explanation is sug·
gested by e. 80, r, that the expense of
separate staffs was saved by giving one
‘legatus' charge of two or more pro·
vinces. Macedonia and Achaia were
restored to the senate by Claudius in
797,11.11. 44 (111060 14, 1, Suet. Cl. 15).
