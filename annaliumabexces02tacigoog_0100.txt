admiral os the empire, with fleets near at hand ¹; and, besides the troops
attached to these, not only the praetoriam guard, bis proper housebold
brigade, but even the police and night-watcb oi the city, owned no
allegiance to any magistrate os tbe republic, but only to Caesar and his
praelects, and formed no insignificant force at his disposal on the spot²7
while the validity oi his imperium within the walls explains his power to
put to death citizens even oi senatorial rank¹2 and he is so sar the
‘imperator' of the whole Roman world, that the whole senate and
people, and even the provinces, take tbe ‘sacramentum' in his name,
binding themselves in the most solemn terms to maintain his authority
against all enemies, and not to hold even their own children dearer‘.
Naturally, intime the ‘imperator' and ⁴ princeps' became synonymous⁸,
and this power was held sufficient in itseli to constitute a principate3
and, although sormally given by senatorial deorse, retained an ominous
memory os theold popular or military origin oi an ‘imperator’s' title ⁸,
andos the irregular democratic command oi Augustus ‘by universal
consent ζ’ out ol which this form of ‘imperium' had risen ς so that even
aconstitutional ruler like Vespasian takes the salutation and ‘sacra-
mentum' oi the soldiers as a valid title, and reckons from it, not from
the senatorial decree, his ‘dies accepti imperii ⁸.' Hence the revelation
oi that ‘state secret' so fruitiul in subsequent history, that ‘a “ princeps '¹
could be made elsewhere than at Rome’;’ and hence the ‘imperator,'
even in proiound peace, felt that ‘he held a wolf by the ears¹⁰,' and
was saie only as long as the soldiers were contented.

11. The tribunician power, which had belonged, as we have seen, in
some form to Augustus from a very early stage oi his career, and to the
dictator before him, still more emphatically recorded the democratic
character of Caesarism,¹ and was not, like the formal office of tribune,
untenable by a patrician. Gracchus and others had shown the lormid-
able political strength ol the tribunale, not only as regarded its wide and
indefinite coercive powers, but also in its legislative initiative. Experience
had no less shown its inherent weaknesses‚ the liability to paralysis by
the veto oi a colleague, the annual tenure with a doubtful chance oi
reelection, and the want ol armed support in caseos the last appeal to
