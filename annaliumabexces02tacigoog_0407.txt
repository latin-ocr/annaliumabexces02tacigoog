the Erus, the army marched along the right bank of the Hase, supported
hya light flotilla conveying supplies ¹, to a point whence the valley of
the Werra and the Weser could be easily reached· The absence of any
resistance need not show that all this district was reduced to submission,
but rather that Arminius had thought fit to collect all his strength behind
the Weser, where his own advantages and the difficulties of the Romans
would be augmented. We have two battles²‚ in which great vic'tories
are claimed, but the first does not prevent the speedy reassemblage of the
enemy, and the sequel of the second is a retreat, not as in the previous
year, at the equinox, but in the height of summer ³, ending in a still
greater disaster, and followed by short incursions ⁴, apparently intended,
lilre that of two years previously, to restore the morale of the troops.
This premature retreat may have been due to unmentioned reverses, to
the incleasing difficulty of feeding an isolated army, or to other causes,
but all explanation is mere conjecture.

The one more campaign, still longed for by the sanguine leaderl, if it
had gone on the lines of those before it, might probably have been
planned on the supposition that the army should be conveyed or attended
by the lieet up the Weser and Aller to the neighbourhood of the Elbe.
But for this a new fleet was needed; the dangers of sea transport had
proved to heaven greater than those of a land march3 the Romans had
secured no ground beyond the Weser; and an advance to the Elbe
would have brought them dangerously near to the great organisation of
the hitherto neutral Maroboduus ⁸.

All this Tiberius must have known, also that German warfare had
entered on a new stage since his own day, hythe growth of military
discipline ⁷, and the rise of a leader of genius. So·called victories might
still be won ; but the Germana had always an easy refuge in the foresta,
and could soon collect again to harass a retreating enemy. To hold the
country, roads would have to be restored· or created in every direction‚
strong winter camps formed in several places, the chief rivers permanently
occupied by a fleet. Even thus the result might yet be doubtful owing
to the absence of towns among the Germans, their unsettled homes and
