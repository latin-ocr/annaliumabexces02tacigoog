or about an. rto-114. It would thus fall before the publication of the
Annals, and adds to the interest of accounts there given of affairs in that
prortnce. Among his friends, besides Pliny, were the latter’s friends,
justus Fabius¹ (probably the consul of nu. 102) and Asinius Rufus²;
and his name appears to occur with other literary men in the will of
Dasumius, dated an. 109⁸.

There is no evidence that he outlived Trajan, nor is he known to have
left any children, but he was claimed as an ancestor by the emperor
Marcus Claudius Tacitus, in the third century ⁴, and by Polemios, a friend
of Sidonius Apollinaris, in the fifth ⁸. It was probably at the earlier of
these dates that the people of Interamna (Terni), the birthplace of
Tacitus the emperor, claimed the historiari also as their citizen; and
erected a tornb to him, which remained till the latter part of the
sixteenth century, when it was destroyed by order of Pius V, as that of
an enemy of Christianity⁸.

The date of completion and publication of his various worhs rests on
internal evidence.

The Dialogue ‘de Oratoribus’ is, by most critics, accepted as his, and
as his earliest work. lt professes to have been written some time after
the discourse was held ⁷, but can hardly be dated later than the earlier
part of Domitian's rule⁸.

The ‘Agricola' belongs to 850 or 851, nn. 97 or 98. Some expres·
sions in the beginning best suit the time when Trajan was associated
with Nerva. At the end Trajan is styled ‘princeps ’ἶ

The ‘Germania’ is also to be assigned to the latter of these years,
frorn a computation of tirne to the second consulship of Trajan ¹⁰.

The ‘Histories’ must have appeared after the apotheosis of Nerva, but
probably early ¹in the principate of Trajan, before the ‘ Annals' were even
contemplated ¹¹.

This last worlr must have been completed when the conquesta of
Trajan had reached their highest point, in 868 or 869, aa. 115 or 116,
and before the retrocession under Hadrian ¹².
