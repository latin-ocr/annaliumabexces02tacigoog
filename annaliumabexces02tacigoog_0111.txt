find, that even on purely military questions, though their unaslred inter·
ierence is resented ¹, they are represented as sharing a responsibility ¹.

To maintain such double govemment in true equilibrium would be
impossible, even is honestly attempted; but the hollowness oi this ap-
parent duality is clearly seen, not only in that the power os the swordia
wholly excepted from it, but also in the securities taken by the princepe
to ensure a subservierit senate.

Admission to this body, as wellas promotion to its higher ranks, was
ordinarily gained through magistracy; and the abolition os the comitia
would have test the senate sels-elective, were not the choice oi candidates
influenced irt two distinct modes by Caesar.

(ι) Any influentia} citizen in the old Republic might intormally com·
mend a candidate, by introducing him to the tribes, and canvassiug sot
him. Augustus originally supported his friends in this manner ⁸3 but in
and after 761, ab. 8,a formal written ‘commendatio' is substituled‘.
Hencelorth in each electiori we have ‘candidati Caesaris ⁸,' in respect oi
whom the comitia, and afterwards the senate, have a mere cong! d ’llr're‘3
and this right os ‘ commendatio' is strictly guaranteed in the ‘lex' con·
serring the principare at each succession ⁷. The proportion oi such
candidates is definite, and not large; in the quaestorship apparently only
two⁸ out ol twenty ⁰, in the praetorship four out ol twelve ¹⁰3 with some
unknown proportion ol tribunes and aediles ¹¹.

(a) The presiding magistrate at the old comitia could always refuse to
receive the name oi, and reject votes tendered sor, an unqualified candi·
date ¹². Out os this grew a right, claimed by Caesar as chief magistrate,
to ⁴ nominate ' candidates, as well asto ‘commend ¹⁸! Such ‘nominatim'
made by publishing a list os candidates, implied no more than that they
were qualihed to receive votes, and might contain any number os names;
but it was the interest, and probably a common practice, os the princeps,

such reporta become rare except where number. There was also right oi commen·
