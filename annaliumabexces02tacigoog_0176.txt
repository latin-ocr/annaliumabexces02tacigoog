memory would have escaped the worst stains cast upon it. Yet, had
he lived up throughout to the level oi hisbest time; his want ol originality
and seli-reliance‚ his'pedantic adherence to the rules, without grasping
the great ideas of his predecessor ¹, would have made it no more than
a period ol good administration without advance²; and a rule which in
duration is equalled by none till Antoninus Pius, aud exceeded by none
till Constantine, would probably have been barren of historical interest.
To waive all comparison with the great names of Roman Imperialism,
even amuch weaker ruler, Claudius. has lest his mark ruore on the history
nithe empire. Nor is a change oi character, even late in tite, in his case
difficolt to explain. At the best, his virtues were those oi the subject
or subordinate ruler rather than os the autocrat ;> and the principato
found him timid, irresolute, and sels-distrustlul, when he had no superior
to rely upon. Hence the necessity alwayS, in estimating his conduct, to
allow sor the influence oi some stronger will, such as the imperiousness
oi his mother, or the erait of Seianus; and hence, when all these were
removed, the neglect even oi routine duties ior want ol a trusted adviser
at his side. Hence again the senseol isolation³ redoubling his seara, and
making him see a fresh enemy at every turn, who must be struck down
to make lise sale to him.

He ia, indeed, probably entitled to all the credit that has been claimed
sothim, as throughout a just and liberal ruler os the provinces⁴3 the
