this weakness of evidence, it is natural that great stress should he laid
on the strong intrinsic improbability that a seli-control apparently well

that alife of such sensuality should last without medical aid to nearly
seventyeight. Upon the whole, therefore, the most just as vell
as the safest verdict appears to be that of aequittal, or at least ‘not
