appointed by Caesar, having no colleagues ¹, with duties specifically
assigned by him, and holding office during his pleasure.

The old magistrates are indeed styled ‘mere names’3' still itis
admitted that, in the best days ol Tiberius, ‘consuls and praetore had
their proper state, even the lesser magistrates had their powers iu
exercise ³ ;' and this admission can be supported by detail.

The office ol consul, though no longer, aa a rule, tenable throughout
the year, and lowered as 1 distinction by the multiplicatiou ol ‘consuler
sullecti‚’ or ol ‘consulares' who had received only the ‘omamenta,‘yet
shares such dignity as remains to the senate 3 with whom the consuluere
the official channel ot communication ⁴, and its regular presidents when
it meets either as a deliberative ⁸ or judicial⁸ body. They can also stit
issue edicts to the people⁷‚ and a survival even ol their old summary
power ot lile and death is yet traceable ⁸. It is indeed probable that the
other magistrates, both through increase ot' their number, and through
transference ol many ol their duties to imperial officere, must bave oltea
had merely honorary iunctions3 still, ol the twelve praetore, the tvo
loremost have their old ‘ iurisdictio '‚' and others preside at tlte ‘quaes-
tiones perpetuae ’θ ;’ also the important charge os the aerarium ¹¹, aad the
‘cura ludonrm,' transferred from the aediles ¹¹, belonged to this body.
The aediles, ol whom probably two were curule and four plebeim,
though no doubt relieved ol their ‘ cura annonae' by the ‘praefectae'
retain a certain ‘cura urbis’ with power to regulate markets and prices ¹⁸,
to control places ol public resort ¹⁴, and to impose lines¹⁵.

The ten tribunes ol the people appear still to have retained their seat

of honour in senate ¹⁸ and theatre ¹², their viatores ¹⁸, and also their ⁸ ius
relationis ¹⁹, and some coercive powers ²⁰, and, ou sufferance‚ even their
