svare by the ‘numen Angustl' in bis
litetime. appears lrom Hor. lipp a. r,
16. Specimens oi such oaths are given
by Marqnsrdt (Staatsv. lii. p. 463) from
C. 1. L. ii. 172, and C. I. G. 1983.

1. notuere. This verb, frequent inthe
Annals (eg. 4. 7,a: 6. 8, ιο, ra. 8. 3,
erc), is one ol those found in no earlier
prose(1ntrod.v. ξ 70).

oonsulibus. ks the praetor presided
in the law-courts, so the consuls preside
at all judicial prooeedings ln the senate;
on which see Introd. vi. p. aa.

a. caelum (=·caelestes bonores'), au
expression somewbat startliag lroru its
concisencss: see E. Jacob.

4. ludis, &a Dio (56. 46, 5) describes
this three days' festival held by livia in
the Palatium, as datiag irom the apo·
theosis; but the words ol Tacitus imply
its earlier existence. It is generallyideu·
tified with the sceuic ‘ludl Palatini’
(Suet. Cal. 56) described by Jose hus
(Aut. 19. r, 13), in his account ol³ the
assassination oi Gaius during them.

7. perinde...qusm si: cp.13. 49.
3. The expression is pccullar to Taci-
tus, who hss also ‘perinde qnam‘ (a. 1,
a,&c.). ‘Perinde' aad ‘ proinde' are osten
confused in the MS. through abbreviatione
(cp. 3. 17, 53 4. ao, 6, aad notes there).

8. deorum intur-iss dis cursa This
is su old maxim of Roman Law, which
therefore reirair'red ironr imposing legal
tl²¹³¹n...st‘..ntl.l.·.rta‘lrgt‘tli
deum ultorem habet' (Cod. 4. 1, a). ln
some cases however perjury ⁴ per Genium
pripcipis' was ‘maiestas'z see Staatsr.
u. ιο.

9. praetorem. Bithynia was goremed
by senatorial proconsule oi praetorian
rank. lts governor is properly styled

‘proconsul' (cp. 16. 18, gl, but here,
as in 443,5 (‘ praetorem Achaiae’t,
‘praetor' is used, as also by Cic. Liv.
&a (see Staatsr. ii. 240, 5l, ol a governor
as such: cp. ‘praetorium’ ‘cohors prac-
torla,' dcc. ln 415, 3, it is uscd even
ol the consular proconsul ol Asia. The
name ol Granius Marcellus is found on
coins ol this date oi the Bithyniam Apa-
meia: see Nipp.

Bithyniae. This province included
not only tbe country generally known
by that name, separated from Mysia and
Phrygia by the Rhyndacus and Olympus,
aad extending eastward to the Parthe-
nius: but also the westem part ol the
Pontio kingdom, added to it by Cn.
Pompeius, and extendin along the Paph-
lagonlan coast to the llalys. The chief
towns la Bithynia are Nicomedeia and
Nicaea, and in the Ponric portion Aruas·
tris and Sinope (the latter a colony ol
Julius Caesar). The province was sub·
sequently Caesariaa, and much of our
knowledge ol it is derived from thc
correspondence ol tbe younger Pliny, as
its governor, with Trajan. See Staatsv.
i. 34 ,loll

rol quaestor ipsius. This was coa·
trary to Roman sentiment. See Cic. Div.
ia Caec. 11, 18.

postulavit. The genitivo with this
verb, on the analogy ol ⁰ accuso,’ &c is
conlined to Tacitus (3. 66, ας 70, a, sac.)
and Suetonius.

subscribente. This term, in the sense
ol ‘signing tbe accusation,' might be
used ol the principal or sole accuser: but .
evidently here, as in many other places
(cp. Cic. ad Q. F. 3. 3, a; Veli. a69,
5; and ‘subscriptor‚' ‘subscriptio' Cic.
Div. iu Caec. 15, 47-49), denotes that

he appeared as subordinate to Crispinus.
