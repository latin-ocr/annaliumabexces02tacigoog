deiecta ¹, corrected in his own case by 'an ardent study oi the gr'eat

classical models oi Roman eloquence, particularly Cicero. He lays·
the sceneos this Dialogue in 827, an. 74 ², when he would be not more
than twenty, possibly riot more than eighteen years of age; and repre-
sents himself in it as even then on ternis of friendship with the leaders
oi the Roman bar³. There is considerable probability in the suggestion
that he was also at some tirne a pupil oi Quintilian ⁴.

Three years later, Cn. Julius Agricola, who had already reached the
first rank in the state, and established the reputation which he was
afterwards to extend, selected him, a young man oi from twenty-one
to twenty-three, as his son·in·law⁸. The rank, and the personal char·
aeter ol Agricola, justiiy us in assuming, that the chosen husband os
his daughter would be a young man not only oi moral excellence, but
oi already assured position and promise.

Some two to lour years later, he entered the senate as quaestor ⁸. By
the age oi thirty-two or thirty-four, he had attained, besides the praetor·
ship‚ a place among the ‘Quindecimviri sacris faciundis ',' one oi the old
priestly colleges, the memhers oi which were generally men oi good rank
and family. ’

Up to this time Tacitus may be assumed to have lived in Rome,
employed chiefly in the sorensic practice, his eminence in which has
been described by Pliny, perhaps also occupied in such literary work
as could be saiely pannea,- or in collecting material ior greater things in
contemplation.

During the next four years, irom 842 to 846, an. 89 to 93, he was
absent irorn Rome ⁸, probably in command oi some Caesarian province
os the second rank⁹. That of Gallia Belgica hasbeen suggested, as
a position in which he may have acquired‘ such personal knowledge as
he shows respecting the German peoples
