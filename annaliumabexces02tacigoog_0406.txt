ΟΝ THE CAMPAIGNS OF GERMANICUS. 389

back to the sources of the Ems and Lippe ¹, in other words, to a point
that could have been easily reached in a few days by the Lippe and
Aliso. We may find a lrey to this in the brief record of the submission
of the Chauci² (possibly coupled with that of the western part of the
Angrivarii ⁸), and may suppose that to secure the whole lower country to
the Weser by the enrolment of this widespread people⁴ in the Roman
ranlrs' was a worthy object for this circuit. Thence the whole united
army is flung upon the Bructeri, another eagle recovered, and this
powerful tribe lopped off from the resources of Arminius ⁵. Passing over
the burial of the remains of the army of Varus* as a mere episode
suggested by nearness to the spot, and unduly amplified by reason of its
capabilities for pictoresque description, we can see that the remaining
object of the campaign would be to bring the main body of the enemy to
battle, and inflict such a defeat as should crush all remaining resistance
to the Weser. Somewhere between the Ems and that river a battle is
delivered, but its result is unsatisfactory, and it is therefore brielly
described ⁷, and followed by an immediate retreat, turned into a ‘clades ⁸⁹
by the straits and narrow escape of the army of Caecina, and the almost
total loss of the baggage and supplies both of this force⁹ and of the two
legions nearly drowned through their inexperience of equinoctial tides ¹⁰.
The magnitude of the loss is shown by the contributione not only from
Gaul but from Spain and even Italy ¹¹, aud by the emboldenment of the
, Germans in the following spring to attempt an attaclr on Aliso ¹². Itis
notable that in repelling this, Germanicus is carried almost to the Weser,
the point to be afterwards reached by the whole army in so wide
acircuit¹³.

ln the great campaign of 769, mo. 16, we are again perplexed by the
disproportion between the preparations and the end effected, which was
no more apparently than the transport by ship of the whole army to the
point similarly reached in the previous year by half of it¹⁴. The
description of the ships built¹⁵ shows that they were not all intended
for the same kind of service3 and we should hardly be wrong in thinking
that, while the larger and more sea-going lleet was left at the mouth of
