cun. lh] GENUINENESS OF THE ANNALS. 9

ternal evidence to show that it is at least the work of arr ancient
author.

We have no reason to suppose that any scholar os the time oi
Bracciolini had access to historians oi this period who are lost to us.
Even those whom we have must have been known to him only in
manuscripts. The inventor oi a Tacitean history oi the principata of
Tiberius or Nero must act as any scholar would now have to act who
desired to compose a Tacitean history oi that oi Gaius or Domitian. He
must make the best use os Dio Cassius and Suetonius, and of whatever
could be gleaned irorn other authors, and must invent the rest os the
material, as well as the form and language. Any careiul comparison
oi the Annals with these sources will show how large a proportion
oi the whole narrative as it stands will have ιο be set down thus to
invention ; and in testing such a theory, the details become important,
almost in proportion to their intrinsic unimportance.

Ii it can be shown that even a moderate number oi facts, such as
would be unhlrely to occur to an inventor, stated in the Annals, and in
no other extant author, are confirmed by coins and inscriptions, most
oi which were certainly, and all oi them probably. unknown in the
fiiteenth century; the supposition oi so many felicitous accidents will
be generally conceded ιο pass the bounds oi reasonable probability.

In the Books comprised in the first Medicean MS, the following corr·
firmations, most oi which are already well known to editors, will be
found :-

1‚Germanicus is stated to have been augur ¹, flamen ², and im-
perator³ ; and all these titles are confirmed ⁴.

2. His eldest son Nero is stated to have been espoused to the
daughter os Creticus Silanus⁶. An inscription gives the name ‘Iunia
Silani [s.‚ spon]ra Neronis Caeditur] ’ἶ

3. The honours decreed to Germanicus at his death are enumerated ⁷,
and in another place it is stated that those decreed to Drusus were in
the rnain the same ⁸. The remains oi tablets recording these decrees,
though extremely fragmentary‚ appear to suggest confirmation oi some
of the details, such as the insertion oi the name in the Salian hymn,
the exhibitiorr os the effigy at the ‘Circenses’ and the erectiori oi arches
(Jani) at three diiierent places ⁹.

4. L. Apronius, and P. Cornelius Dolabella, stated to have been at
different times proconsuls os Africa ¹⁰, are shown ιο have been so by
