and hardly receives its lull significanee till the adoption oi Trajan.
Similarly the title oi ¹ princeps iuventutis,' though sometimes taken to
mark out a successor¹‚ might be shared by more than one ¹, and was
usually dropped at manhood. Far more influence would be exerted
by the association oi an intended heir in the ‘proconsulare imperium,’
or ‘tribunicia potestas,' or, as was the case with Tiberius, in both¹.
But this step was rarely taken, and might even be dangerous, ior not
every heir could be so trusted ⁴. ‘Proconsulare imperium’ seems indeed
'capable os degrees, and was given to Germanicus ¹, probably to Drusus ⁸,
probably also to Seianus ¹, in a lower form than the lull ‘consortium'
held hy Tiberius¹ with Augustus. The tribunician power seems to be
treated as more significant, and is shared still more sparingly; with
Augustus only by Agrippa and Tiberius, with Tiberius only by Drusus¹3
never again, till shared by Titus with Vespasian¹02 and even Tiberius,
when first admitted to share that power, must have felt that others stood
nearer to the succession than he.

But whatever the position oi the expectant successor, the tornat
choice lay with the senate, and its ratification with the comitia ¹¹, and
the powers were again defined nt each succession ¹¹. In any case, the
principate is no monarchy in which ‘the king never dies3’ there is
always an interval, during which its character as an excrescence of the
revolution reappears‚ in that no ⁴ interrex’ is needed as it the republic
had been leit without eniel magistrates. The competence ol the consuls
still survives ; to them a living princeps can pretend ²¹, or even oller ¹⁴
to resign; and at his death they carry on government during the
interval ¹¹, and the lorm ol the constitution is still complete.

The senate again at these epochs may assert itsels by ‘condemning
