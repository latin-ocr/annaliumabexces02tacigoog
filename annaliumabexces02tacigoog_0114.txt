cm. vt] CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLYPRINCIPATE. 97

curule cheir, the laurel-wreath and lictors ¹. His household troops keep
the old title of ‘cohors praetoria! Nor is Dio right in representing him
aa ‘legibus solutus¹;' his special exemption from some laws' implying
that he is bound by all others. Again his family have no dignities
except by special decree. Livia, the type in early times of exceptional
female privilege, received tribuniciae sanctity, and was made ¹ sui iuris’
in her husbaud's lifetime⁴2 her honours at his death were strictly
limited'; her deification at the time of her death refused ⁶; her political
influence was only personal: not till after Domitian does ‘Augusta'
become a regular title⁷2 only Agrippina seems substantially to share
the power of husband or son, and to be in very deed an ‘empress⁸:'
the association of the sistere of Gaius in the oath⁰ seems a mere freak
of power: sona of the ruling house are no more than, and are not
always, ‘principes iuventutis¹⁰’ in youth; and are afterwards enabled
only by special decree ¹¹ to forestall the lawful age for magistracies: the
households of Caesar are at first no greater than those of other eminent
citizens ¹¹; his secretaries, accountants, tre, no higher than freedmen.
lt was however inevitable that the extreme importance of the office
should exalt its holder, and we fmd by the time of Claudius that his
three principal freedmen, especially the chief treasurer of his ‘fiscus'
have become the most important functionaries in the state ¹⁸.

Nor could the princeps formally name a successor; much as he could
do indirectly to guide the choice of one. The person left heir in his
will had a position of vantage by succeeding to the ‘fiscus' in which .
public money was mingled with the ‘res privata principis ε’ yet neither
Livia¹⁴ nor Tiberius Gemellus ¹⁸ acquired by heirship any share os
empire. An act of adoption by the princeps is figuratively called by
Tacitus ‘comitia imperii ι’ς’ but such adoption uras not limited to one ¹⁷,
