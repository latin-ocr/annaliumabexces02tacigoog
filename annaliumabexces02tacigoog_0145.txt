more consideration than the rowers ¹, are so far on a par with them that
we find both rewarded with the ‘civitas' after twenty-six years' service¹.
The ships are usually either ‘triremes’ or ‘Liburnae ’,' and are dis·
tinguislred by names like modern ships ⁴. The captains, whether oi
triremes or Libumians, are designated aa ‘trierarchi ⁶! We baveno
knowledge of the strength of these flecta ς which are little mentioned in
general, but acquire some prominence in the civil war of 822, a. n. ⁶9·

Various auxiliary fleets, whether of ships of war⁸ or transports',
existed in the provinces, and are mentioned in various inscriptions ⁸.

The total strength of all these forces can be only very roughly esti·
mated. Taking the legion with its auxiliaries at 10,000, we have a total
of a5o,ooo for the main armies; to which the horne army, the ‘clas-
siarii' and all the various detached forces may add a further total of
100‚ooo. This it should be remembered represents at that time the
whole military and naval force oi the civilised world.

On the pay and grievances oi the soldier it is sufficient to refer to the
narrative of the mutiny ', and the contrast there drawn between the
legionaries and the praetorians; while a more favourable estimate of
military privileges, nt a somewhat later date, can he formed from the six·
tecnth Satire of Juvenal; and some information as to the rewards on
retirement, chiefly the gift of 'civitas’ to auxiliaries, and the ratification
of marriages generally ¹⁰, can be gathered from the various ‘diplomata ¹¹!
'l'o those of higher rank, many further advantages were attainable.
Centurions, besides being promoted to such posta as the command ol
auxiliary cohorts or squadrons ¹², or the rank of ‘praefecti castrorum ¹³,'
had regular pensions on retirement ¹⁴, and the ‘primipili' appear to have
retained even for life the title of ‘primipilares¹³,' and to have been

appointed to responsible posts in the army, or as subordinate govemors
of provincial districts ¹⁸.
