construction with nearly the foroe of a
simple dat. (c. 78,1; lutrod. aideb).
With ‘formidolosum’ ‘erat' might be
supplied, or it might be in apposition
with ‘quod,’and ‘et' might have the force
of ‘etiam’; ‘which eren his father was
said to have censured. as alarming to the
people' (the ‘vilis sanguis‘ of Rome).

suggested by the marginal ‘sed' and
