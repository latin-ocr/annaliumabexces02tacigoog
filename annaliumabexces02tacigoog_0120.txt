under the title of ‘equites inlustres’ or other similar names¹3 men of
senatorial census, or even among the wealthiest in the state ², who
remained within the equestrian rank from choice. Of these the most
famous was Maecenas, and those who filled similar positions in imperial
confidence after him, as Sallustius Crispus³ and Seianus, and many
others who by filling such offices as the important ‘praefecturae’ in
Rome⁴ and that of Egypt⁵ held a position superior to most senators ⁶.
The equestrian order was thus a gainer hy the revolution, both through
the relative depression of the order above them, and through the special
career of emolument and distinction held out to them. Throughout
the empire, the ‘societates’ of persons qualified for this rank farmed the
revenue⁷‚ and the residence of their superiors at Rome left them the
aristocracy of municipal Italy and the provinces, and many might pass
from the lower to the higher rank of their order by the emperor’s favour.
The gift of this higher rank, that of ‘Eques Romanus’ in the proper
sense, tenable for life, and always ltept by the princeps in his own hands,
opened a public career of continually increasing dignity and importance,
starting with officerships in the army ⁸, and leading up, through one civil
appointment aiter another, to what were in fact the most influential posts
in tbe state '. Thus had the emperors set up beside the old hereditary
senmorial nobilitya personal nobility of their own creation, and turned
to their advantage and the public service the long-standing rivalry ol the
orders ¹⁰.

The resident senators and knights with their wives and children, and
many of the families of those absent on foreign service, formed an upper
population in Rome, variously estimated at from ro,ooo to nearly 50,ooo ¹¹.
To these wealthy classes belonged most of the ‘domus’ or palaces¹¹,
filling, with their gardens and grounds, so large a portion of the city ;
