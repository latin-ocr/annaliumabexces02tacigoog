cmv] THE svam ΛΝΒ STYLE OF TACITUS. 67

76. nendicans, or the coordination os two words, oi which one,
usually the second, defines the other like an adjective or genitive (sce

Madv. 482 2), appears to be used by Tacitus, alter the example ol poets
(as Verg. G. 2. 292), more frequently than by earlier prose writers; and,
though many ol the examples usually cited (see Ruperti, Ind. iii.) are
hardly genuine, many remain; e. g. tempus atque iter 2. 34, 6; gaudio
et impetu 3. 74, 6; lamam et posteros 22. 6. 2; testamenta et orbos
23. 42, 7, tte. Introd. to Germania, p. 10‚Dr.§ 243.

77. Anastrophe of propositione, though restricted to the usual
limits (see hladv. 469) in the minor works, and rarely extended beyond
thern in the Histories, is used with more poetical freedom in the Annals
than in the work ol any other prose author.

(1) Alter a substantive without an attribute; e. g. abusque
23. 47, 2, &c.; coram r. 19, 3, &c.; extra 23. 47, 2; intra 22. ao, 43
inter 6. 42, 2, &c.; intra 3. 75, 4, &c.; iuxta 2. 42, 2, &c.; propter
4. 48, r,&c.; super 26. 35, a: sometimes even alteragenit. as 3. r, ις
¹3· ¹5²& 14· 92 3·

(2) Between two coordinated substantives; eg. inter 4. 50, 3;
59, a; 69, 2, tec. This and the above usage do not extend to mono·
syllahic preps.

(3) With substantive preceding and attribute following3
eg. ab 3. ro, 4; in 22. 3, 2; 12. 56, r, &c.; intra rr. 36, 4.

(4) Between a substantive and dependent genitive; eg.
ab 4. 5,4; ad 3. 72, 2, &c.; apud 6. 32,4; inter 4. 26, 6, &c

(5) Between two substantives in apposition 3 e. g. ab 2. 60, 2,
&cc apuu 4· 42. ⁶3 in 15· 53, 3·

(6) Alter two coordinated substantives; eg. inter t. 60, 53
coram 4. 8, 7, &c ; simul 4. 55, 3.

ot these, all except (2) are used by Tacitus only in the Annals, and sew
instances occur in earlier prose. ΒΓ.) 225, wctfflin, Philol. xxv. 115,
Nippon r.6o; r.6o; 3. 2; 2ο, 72.

78. Anasta-opha of coniunctione is also very common; among the
stronger instances is the position ol si as sourth word 14. 3, 3 ; ut 22
fifth 22. 49, 3, quasi as seventh 24. 52, 2; cum as tenth 1. 63, 6. But
such instances‚ as well as those os anastrophe os relative pronounS, as in
4. 33, 2; 22. 62, 4; or ol adverbs, as adeo 23. 35, 2, &c., are not
without classical precedent. Dr. ξ 227, 228, Nipp. on 22. 5r; 15. 39.

79. The occurrence οἰ metriccl lines, or parts of such in
Tacitus requires notice chiefly because it has been noticed (Botticher,
Proleg. p. xcvi, Ruperti Ind. iii, Dr. § 255, Nipp. on 1. r). lilost ol
