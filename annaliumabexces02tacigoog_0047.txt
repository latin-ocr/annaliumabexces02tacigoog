30 INTRODUCYION. [eur. tv.

The latter would imply the agency of the gods, who are ehewhere
recognized aii origimtors os ἀεοιίιιγ ¹, and mlers of man md nature ³,
sometimes as mring at least tn punish ⁸, if not to protect ¹. sometimes n
timeae who would bless ns if our sins permitted them ¹, sometimes iu
pnrsuing their purpoee with sublime indifference to our good deeds
or evil'.

The Epicurean doctrine, that the deity cares sor none of us, that good
or bad are fortunate or unfnnunaie as blind chance may guide, is hrielly
dism'med in thi- pasmge. ln an atheistic form it was no doubt un-
aoeeptnble to Tacitus und to general opinion, though popular enough,
u Pliny has shown ¹, when brought into apparent harmony with religion
by ihe eiastic theology which worshipped fortune as a goddess· and
reconciled oppoffles by the apotheosis os ι negarim-i.

The Sioic theory, as stated in the sanie place, besides repeating ihe
well-known doctrine, that the good are never really miser-ahie nor the
wicked happy, reeonciles destiny and freewill by supposing that nster
mim has made his ‘choiee οἱ lise‚' its consequenoes are determined, not
by planetary influences but by natural causation. Α more extreme, and
apparently more popular theory, to which Tacitus evidently inclines,
would hold that our destiny is fixed srorn the moment uf our birth, and
could be soretold from our horoscope, were we sure ns our interpreter:
but that the true professors are few, und ihe an discredited by the
multitude os quachs.

Eelieving in astrology, he believed also in prodigies and omens' as
means whereby the future was revealed ; but here again he wunld say
that miiinterpretaiions were rise ¹⁰, and that many prognostications were
only recognized ns such after the event ¹¹.

Elsewhere he often uses popular lnnguage in which fortune nnd
