data give a result varying from more than a million to less than half
that sum ¹.

Similar uncertainty attends the attempt to estimate the mass of public
and private urban slaves. They are generally called a vast multitude²;
the ‘familia' of Pedanius Secundus alone numbers 400⁸, still the
majority of the plebs must have had none or next t0 none, and many
poor knights or senators very few. Α reasonable estimate takes theru at
800,000 or 900,000, who, with perhaps 60,000 peregrini, and a garrison
of 20‚000 ⁴, may malle up the million and a hali to two millions of souls
in Rome ¹.

To this vast crowd the chief gift ol Augustus was a fairly efficient
organisation oi police. The city was partitioned into iourteen ‘regiones'
each allotted to the charge of one ol the magistrates sor the year ⁸.
Under these were grouped the 465 ‘vici¹,' or quasi-parochial corpora·
tions, choosing each their four wardens or ‘vico-magistri ⁸,’ whose duties,
though mainly religious, were also in part constabulary ¹, at least till the
institution in 756, an. 6, 04 the ‘vigiles ¹⁰,' who were so distributed that
each cohort, 1000 strong, had watch and ward oi two regions ¹¹, to guard
from lire and robbery; both of which were still rife enough in crowded
districts, and streets lit only by the poor passenger's lamp-wick, and now
and then by the rich man's torch train ¹¹. Besides the ‘vigiles' the urban
and praetorian guards were in reserve, 44 needed, and the police magis-
tracy‚ beyond such powers as remained to aediles and other magistrates ¹⁸,
rested with the city praefect ¹⁴.

The principale of Tiberius seems on the whole to mark the period
when the populace are least considered ¹¹. They take the oath of allegiance
at his accession ¹⁸, and then seem to retire from prominence. They have
no votes to sell¹¹, the general tie of clientship had thereby become
more unmeaning, and the rabble are not yet the ‘clientela Caesaris!
