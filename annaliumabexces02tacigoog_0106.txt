cun.v1.]CONSTITUT10N OF THE EARLY PRINCIPATE. 89

Claudius¹; which pamed, at a later time, into a permanent body ol
salaried jurists’.

This body is distinct from the more definite political committee of
twenty senators, regularly appointed in virtue os magistracy or by lot ³,
lor discussion ol questions to be afterwards submitted to the fult house ⁴3

though these persons might also occasionally act as judicial assessorsl.
These again must be distinguished from the confidential advisers ol the
princeps, as Sallustius Crispus, Seneca, dc, and lrom the cabinet council
ol ‘proceres' summoned on emergencies ⁸.

Notwithstanding these powers, the early ‘princeps' has no such
monarchy as that ol Diocletian or Constantine3 nor, on the other hand,
does the principate follow the democratic lines traced by the dictator
Caesar, whose memory Augustan literature seems to have been instructed
rather to obliterate than to glorify ¹.

The popular assemblies, suspended by the triumviri, restored, but
gradually controlled by Augustus ⁸, are practioelly abolished at his
death ⁹. From this time, whatever share they may have retained in the
lorms ol legislation ¹⁰, their most important function, that ol electing
the magistrates ol the state, survives at most in the plebiscite, following
a ‘senatusconsultum' by which tribunician power is conferred on the
princeps or his associate ¹¹3 or, in other elections‚ in a mere formal
‘renuntiatio’ ol the choice made by the senate ¹⁸. The importance ol
this change is only paralleled by the ease with which it appears to have
been ellected

While the people thus cease to bave any direct share in government,
and lind their only representation in the democratic side ol imperialism,
the Caesars hai-e made their peace with the aristocracy, and in outward
form share a dual government with it. There are two sets ol magis-
trates; on the one hand, the old republican and senatorial hierarchy os
consuls, praetore, &e.; on the other, the praelects and other delegates
ol the princeps: the former, as ol old, elected to office, grouped in
‘collegia’ partitioning duties by lot, with annual tenure: the latter
