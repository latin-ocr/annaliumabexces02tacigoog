or killed (c. 32, 3) had to be hlled up.
But ‘centurionatus’ which (according to
Nippl is found only in Val. Max. 3, s, 23,
an in an inscription oi Antonine times
(C. 1. L. x. 3340), must mean, lilre the
rather less rare ‘centuriatus' (Cic. and
Suet. Gramm. 24), ‘the ohice oi centurion'
(cp. ‘optionatus' ‘decurionatus’ &cyr
and thus the centurion himself shoud
rather be said ‘centurionatum agere? It
is haps possible, on the analo of
‘di ectum a re,’ to melre the prase
mean 'to ho d an election oi centurione ’;
hut more probably the passage is corrupt.
The most plausible emendation, however,
‘centurionum rentum' (Bernhardy, cited
by Baiter), introduces a word unknown iu
Tacitus and very rare otherwise: aad one
which hardly seems to bear the meaning
here required.

army when these were worn, as in full
dress, is described in H. s. 89, 3.
