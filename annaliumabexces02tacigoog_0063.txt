46 INTRODUC'TION. [cmv.

erat ι. 59, ι. Dr. § 48. The ordinary usage whereby, in expressions
such as cui nomen est, the name itsell is attracted to the case ol the
pronoun, is restricted by Tacitus tc adjectives (as 1. 31, 23 2. 8, 1, &c.):
the nominative (as 1. 45, 1, stc), or, rarely, the genitive (sce note on
4. 59, 2), being used of substantivas. (Nipp. on 2. ι6.) Cp. Madv. 246,
Obs. 2. 3.

17. 'I'he ‘dativus commodi’ is extended to such usages as sibi
...procubuisse 1. 59, 4 ; sibi...lirmabat 1. 71, 5; ut mihi informis, sic
tibi magnilica ra. 37, a; perhaps non referre dedecori 15. 65, 2.

18. 'l'he dative or the agent or subjective dative is used, without
restrictiori to the gerundive or to passive participles or adjectives in
‘bilis’ (Roby 1146), and without any notion ol the interest ol the agent
(Madv. 250 a), in more than thirty places, e. g. sibi . . . adspici ι. ι7, ιο;
propinquis...removeretur 2. 50, 4. Cp. 2. 57, 5; 3. 3, 3; 2ο, 3, &c
lt is not easy always to distinguish this dative srom such ablatives as are
noted in § 27. Dr. § 51, Nipp. on 2. 50, Her. on H. r. ιι, 8, Gud. on
Dial. 4, 8.

19. 'I'he dative ot a noun so closely connected with another
that a genitive would be expected (Roby 1154), frequent in poets, is
also frequent in Livy, and still rnore in Tacitus ; e.g. rector iuveni 1. 24, 3;
paci firmator 2. 46, 6; and very many others. Dr. § 53.

20. 'I'he dative of the thing es object, clten used nith adjectives
οι participles, as promptus 1. 2, ι, &c.; intentus ι. 3ι, 2; facilis 2. 27, 2,
&c.; appears to be an extension ol the usage with persons. See Nipp.
on ιι. 2ι, Madv. 247.

21. 'Phe dative efter compound verbs, where accus. with prep.
would be usual, is also poetical, as pectori adcreverat 1. 29, ι (where
see note) ; penatibus induxerit 5. r, 3, &c

22. Detive of work contemplated. Roby 1156, 1382.

(α) Gerund. Such expressions as restaurando sufficeret 3. 72, 4;
testificando vulgabat ι3. ιι, 2 (cp. 15. 16, a); appear to be exten-

sions ol the classical phrases solvendo esse, scribendo adesse. Dr.
§ 206 Α.

(b) Gerrmdive. '1t is characteristic ol Tacitus to employ this usage
with increasing, and latterly with great frequency: only three instances
being found in the minor works, and thirteen ln the Historias, while it
abounds in the Annals more than in any other Latin author. Itis
used with more than twenty adjectives (see ι. 23, 5; 37, ι; 2, 57, 3,
