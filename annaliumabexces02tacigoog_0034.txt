must have been nearly severity, Pliny was tany-five, Rusticus probably
younger, so that, il their date ol publication ansvered to their age, the
second could probably have used the first, and the third both the others.
The work oi Cluvius, il the long account given by Josephus of the death
oi Gaius was taken from him, must have been voluminous, and the
thirty-one Boolrs oi Pliny cover the history of probably not more than
twenty years.

lt has been shown¹ that Tacitus has referred to the special history
, ol Domitius Corbulo‘3 and he may also have used that oi Suetonius
Paulinus³z but with these our definite knowledge ol even the names of
original authorities lor this period ends. Bruttedius Niger, aedile in 775,
an. aa ⁴, was awriter of history, but our only reference is to his notice
ol the death ol Cicero⁸ ; also Tuscus, the accuser ol Scaurus, appears to
have written a ioolish history of some sortt The references to
Lentulus Gaetulicus, the poet aud epigrammatisti, and to Licinius
Mucianus ⁸, hardly prove thern to have been historians; Cremutius
Cordus appears to have leit oti at an earlier date ⁹; Vipstanus Messala ¹⁰
to have begtm at a later.

Further contemporary materials would no doubt be found in separate
notices ol lamous men, not only in the lorm ol funeral orations, but
also in that ol more detailed biographies, such as those ol Thrasea and
Helvidius by Arulenus Rusticus and Herennius Senecio, and such
other precedente as Tacitus allodes to lor his own biography ol
agricolas. The iulness ol detail found in the description ol all the
actions oi Germanicus, and even oi the progress ol his remains to
Rome, and oi the proceedings alter his death, appears to suggest the
existence oi some such special source of information¹²; the more so
