274 P. CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A. U.C. 7⁶8.

- mortalium incerta, quantoque plus adeptus foret, tanto se magis
in lubrico dictitans non tamen ideo faciebat fidem civilis animi ; 3
nam legem maiestatis reduxerat, cui nomen apud veteres idem,
sed alia in iudicium veniebant, si quis proditione exercitum aut

splebem seditionibus, denique male gesta republica maiestatem
populi Romani minuisset: facta arguebantur, dicta inpune erant.
primus Augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis specie legis eius 4
tractavit, commotus Cassii Severi libidine, qua viros feminasque
inlustres procacibus scriptis diffamaverat: mox Tiberius, consul·

‘sacramentum in nomen principis' (sce

accus. and inf. pass, as in 1412, ⁶,5 H.
afri,ettadtrumhere:
ston, request, or direction, is noted by
Madvig (396, Obs. tl as contrary to the
usage of the best writers: see oa c. 74,

³· lenem malestatis reduxerat. Oa
the history of this law and its applica·
tion under the Republic see latrod. viii.

. 141. The same expression is used in
hliny, Pan. 11 ‘dicavit caelu Tiberius
Augustum, sed ut maiestatis legem re·
duceret’; but the implierl assertion that
it had beccum obsolete must be qualibed
by the lact of its extension aad recent eu-
foroemeut by Augustus: see below.

4. sl quis . . . seditionibus. These
two instances seem cited from Cicero.
who specifies them as cases falling uruler
the law (de Qrat. 2. 39‚164; Partitt. 30,
{resciscerent} athela
‘mmursset’

6. populi Romani. These words seem
intended to stand in contrast to its appli-

dtots inpune eraut. That pas-
quinades were capitally punishable‚ even
hythe laws of the Twelve Tables, is
afhrmed in Cic. de Rep. 4 to, 12;cp.
Hor, Ep. 2. ι, 150, &c On the applica·
bility of the law of ‘ maiestas’ to them.
see next note. ‘lupone esse' is found
again, 2. 52,9; 3. 28,2;12.54,r;ti.

7. primus Augustus: ep. Suet. hug.
55. Seneca says (de lien. 3. 27, ι) ‘suh
divo Augusto nondum hominibus verba
sua periculosa erunt, iam molesta' Yet
the ‘Lex Comelia.¹ even if allowed to
slumber,appears definitely to havelirought
the public utterance of libels under this
offense. ‘Est maiestas, et sic Sulla voluit.
ue ia quemvis impune declamari liceret'
(Cic. ad Fam. 3. 11, 2).

Hor. Sat. 2. 1, 68, &c.

8. Oassil Severi, On his character
see 4. 21, 5. He was probably banished
in 765, ab. 12, when Dio 15117, rr
mentions roceediugs taken against libel-
lers, but, oes not gave their trames. 'l'he
chronology of jerome (see on 4. 21, 5 ,
would give a date four years earlier.

9. diffamaverat. This verb, first
found in Ovid, is used of a personal
object also ia 15. 49, 6, and with accus.
of the report spread in 14. 22, 5: cp. the
similar uses of ‘ differre’ e. 4. 3.

10. Pompeio Moero. On his parentage
aud death see on 6. 18, 4.

ludtols. . . redderentur. Thia is not
strictly equivalent to ‘ius reddere’ t‘ to
give sentence,'e.g. 6 11, r; 13.51, 1,
dte), but rather to ‘iudices dare,' i.e. to
receive aoase aad assign jurors to try it:
