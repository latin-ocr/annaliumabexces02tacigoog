Camillis] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 135

3330333333 01 Rome to facea crisis which, with some apparent iorgetfulness
01 the Teutons and the Cimbri, is called the gravest since the Punic
wars ¹. By the time that this was quelled all had been lost in Germnny
by the annihilation 01 the army ol Varus in 762, n.n.‘9²; and nothing
remained bnt to exact vengeance and secure the frontier. The schemes
01 German conquest would seem to have been less nearly executcd, or
their sensibility more misconceived, than our authorities admit to us; but
the restoration ol order within the empire at least was complete and
permanent, 3ηά the triumph ol Tiberius in 765, n. n. 12, well earned ³.
Nor is there reason to doubt the most distinguishing trait os his general·
ship, bis careiulness 01 his soldiers' lives ⁴, a duty more than ever incumbent
on a general who knew that almost the last reserve 01 Rome was in the
field‘. Rewarded, besides his triumph, with a permanent renewal 01
tribunician power ⁸, and a‘proconsulare imperium ’ apparently coordinata
with that oi the princeps ⁷, he had again set out lor illyricum when the
last illness 01 Augustus recalled him hastily to Italy, which lor the remain-
ing twenty-three years os his lile he never quitted.

Our attention throughout this period must be mainly directed to the
circumstances which formed the character oi the future prince. lt was
evidently always the dearest wish of Augustus to sound a family dynasty.
The principate could never be sonnatly bequeathed⁸, and, hythe first
princeps, even the custom 01 succession bad wholly to be created; but
he seems clearly to have seen that with tact and discretiori he could
practically name his successor3 and, though a sonless man, had no such
noble ambition as Galba conceived and Nerva realized, os directing
choice to the worthicst. Yet he could see that his intended successor
must be ripe in years 3ηά tried in service, prominent enough to be such
as 31333 state might be supposed to choose. Again, the precariousness
01 his own bealth obliged Augustus always to contemplate the possibility
01 3 speedy as well as a distant succession. Hence it was always his
policy to surround his throne with props ⁹, and to bave different heirs in
various grades 01 expectancy. In the first rank were his nearest relatives
to be his choice il time allowed him to make them sufficiently prominent.
Such in the earlier years was Marcellus, and such in later times were
Gaius and Lucius Caesar. Secondly‚ there must be another in reserve,
already ripe in years and tried in real lile, who might fill the chief place
